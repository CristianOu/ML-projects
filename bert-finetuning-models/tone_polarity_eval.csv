TONE_POLARITY,"I didn't go see this in theaters, because it looked REALLY stupid, but when it came out on HBO I gave it a chance because I am a huge Adam Sandler fan. And boy am I glad that I gave this movie a chance! It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny! This is some of Sandler's best work yet.The Hell costumes and sets were fabulous, and I thought that it was remarkable that Adam could keep his face in that weird position for such a long time.I also found that Little Nicky, and an Adam Sandler character from SNL (Gil Graham) share many traits. If you have ever seen this character then you'll know what I mean.Overall, this is a HILARIOUS movie, and I highly reccomend that you rent/purchase it!:-D",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The figures are very cute, but smell like skunk. I have washed them, aired them out, and soaked them. The odor will not come out. So if you want very cute Yu-gi-oh figures, and can get passed the smell, order these.....if you have a good nose, stay clear.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Was thrilled to see the box when this was given to me. As I read more and more about it, my happiness turned to dissapointment. This is a bare bones, barely flies gimmick with cheap stickers and cheaper electronics. It wasn't a total disaster, within 20 minutes we had this thing off the ground and crashed less than a minute later. The most fun we had with it was letting the dog chase it and chasing the dog after she took off with it. It worked for about 5 or 6 flights and provided an hour or so of fun. The 10 minute wait time between charges is a bummer and the minimal 1 to 2 minutes of fly time is a real bummer. But we did have almost 10 minutes of total time in the air and those 10 minutes were fun! The dog ran under the camper with it and was keeping it for herself. If you don't have a dog, you might want to save toward a real flying machine and save yourself the dissapointment.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,I read 31 pages of ego-maniacal drivel devoid of a single sentence written from true self. This is all mind ramblings of an ego that thinks it has found enlightenment. This was a very negative experience for me especially because I can see people getting taken in by this ego embracing enlightenment course. As for me I'll stick with Adyashanti and Eckhart Tolle.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,I could not even finish this book. It was written with such arrogance and puffing!I found the author to be quite contrive about the true nature of the Holocust and more intent on his personal injustice.He was lucky that he was young and had friends in Germany. His father being a king of some sort is put high onhis list of achievements although the treatment of the women involved with himself and his father would not be so prized.I am going to put this one down and go on to something more worth my minds time. ~,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I liked this movie, not because of it's plot,but because of Vladimir Tytla's artwork on it.Frankly the movie [stinks], but the transfer and artwork are magnificent.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is a fantastic sequel to ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". While the first Rich Dad book laid a great foundation and provided some high level direction, this book took what I had learned and added to it. There are some repeat ""lessons"" but they tend to go more in depth and have different examples that help me have a better understanding of the concept. In one of the books RTK uses an example of the financial education that you need to be financially free and compares it to the foundation of a building. These books are helping me lay that strong foundation.As a side note, I listened to the audio CD version of this book and the only things I didn't like were the speakers voice (very robot-sounding) and the fact that every time he mentioned a particular quadrant, he had to say both the letter and name of the quadrant... this got a bit tiresome and a bit Sesame Street sounding (ie ""B, Business"", ""I, Investor"").",,1
TONE_POLARITY,This book is filled with quotations and sayings to help lift you up. When you are having a bad day its great to open this book and find a quote that applies to your situation.

TONE_POLARITY,"I think these have got to be the best headphones for the money out there. I've had mine about a year and an super pleased with them. From great sound, great comfort, I am very happy. I mainly got them to use on flights where I was sick of the engine noise breaking in to the music. I had been using some over ear headphones, but needed something smaller. Much smaller. Enter these sony's.I will concur with one review I read below - the rubber that houses the wires broke down on my and exposed the wires. Annoying, for sure, but I'm just getting another pair. It took them a year and a half of daily use for this to happen, so I am not concerned.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I almost hate to swim against the tide of the glowing reports from other reviewers, but unless you are a big fan of the incredibly fatiguing, downward spiral of interminable Jewish angst and disfuntional relationships (ala Woody Allen), then don't waste your time with this movie. I would almost warn people that if they consider themselves normal and want to stay that way, to watch this movie is a direct threat to their continued mental health. Finally, for those hormone-rich males who are hoping that the ""R"" rating means they will get some rare looks at Ms Harrold's naked form, forget it; there is one VERY brief long shot and that's it. The ""R"" must have come from the occasional filthy language.",,0

Do you feel good about yourself if you can make things easier or smoother for someone else? All without really wanting anything in return but maybe a smile and a wave?Is someone lying to, or about you, undermining you, or taking credit for your efforts, all to improve their perceived lot in the company? Is this person taking away your desire to do your best or go the extra mile?If you can answer yes to _any_ of these questions you owe it to yourself to read this book. It doesn't offer much in the way to get around the situation, but knowing what your up against can help you pick a course before you become roadkill.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The thin backboard cracked and began to bend on the first time out, and the support pieces were pulling away. Its all held together with cheap staples that pull out really easily.I took mine apart, replaced the thin wood with a piece of thick plywood, screwed everything together, and now Im happy. For all the trouble, I'd build my own next time, seeing as I had to rebuild this one and pay for it on top of it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"First, the book was so long, and he never stops describing the characters, towns, villages and other various items untill it's been blown way out of perportion. And next, too many twisting subplots to follow. He writes on one untill some actuall action happens(about 300 pages later), then in the middle of the action, he starts on one that no one can even remember. Ironic, isn't it. At the rate he's writing, hell be dead before the series is finished, and if he isn't, who will care about the climactic finish of him against the Dark One. I certainly won't. The story seams to be getting more and more subplots, without tying any of them off. The first few books were colorful, but then the passion is suddenly gone, with olny one book.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The Eddings have always been likeable for their commentry on the human condition via the use of archetypal characters that represent one type of person (ie, Tolnedrans are materialistic, Angaraks are religiously fanatic etc) What this book fails to do is to come up with characters that are original to Eddings' work! For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book.",,0

I currently use a Norelco and decided it was time to retire it after five solid years of good use. After reading the mixed reviews about the 8894XL I was a little apprehensive about ordering one, but thought I would give it a try. Well I should have trusted my instincts because the unit I received was dead as a door nail. It would not take a charge at all and I was forced to send it back. I think that if a product is that problematic, the manufacturer needs to address the defect immediatley, especially a reputable company like Nolerco.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is like a Bible for dissidents. I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Skyliners takes us across North America, from sea to shining sea, and presents the dawn of the Jet Age in all its glory. Each stop offers an amazing variety of late piston and turboprop and early jet passenger aircraft, ranging from the familiar Boeing 707 and DC-8 to more obscure birds. Those of us who had the good fortune to have witnessed this interesting era in civil aviation will remember with great fondness those United Jet Mailiners, Eastern Golden Falcon Jets, and Delta and American Airlines Flagships and Astrojets.The photos are generally of good quality and well reproduced. The short captions are entertaining, even if they do not have a great deal of substance. What makes this book worth the money is that it offers a seldom seen glimpse to the late 1950s and early 1960s, one rarely seen in such a high-quality format.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"My 18 month old boy normally has a very short attention span (sound familiar?!), but this kitchen/grill set keeps him actively engaged for quite a while! He loves making me a cup of coffee or grilling a burger for dad.My husband and I put this toy together in about 30-45 minutes. I'm sure it would have been harder with only one person. The instructions say not to use a drill, but we did and it was no problem -- much easier/faster!All of our doors fit fine, maybe we just got lucky? I agree more noises would have been nice, but that's what there imagination is for, right?!I definitely recommend this toy!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"When a publisher presents a book as being a work of history knowing that its author's research is suspect to say the least, I believe the consumer has every right to be upset about that.The problem with this book is not the occasional error or fact or misprint but that the author made claims to his qualifications and research that when checked turned out to be very questionable to say the least.It seems he was never a Lord as he claimed, nor ever a Baronet as he claimed, nor a PhD as he claimed. One asks oneself the question why somebody would need to make all these suspect claims if this book was really what it has been made out to be, namely a work of history.It is however a very good read. That is why I give it one star. It is entertaining. I only hope somebody writes a biography of its author one day (how's this for a title - ""The Man of Many Names"") as I am sure that will be even more entertaining.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"As a budget DVD, I suppose I shouldn't complain. This was one of the first movies I upgraded when I bought my DVD player. However, the only thing that makes this DVD better than the VHS is that you can see it in widescreen format.COnsidering many think this is the penultimate King Arthur movie, I would hope that someday the studio would put together a special edition DVD with a few more extras.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The original manga from Masamune Shiro was somewhat a great experience. But instead of just trying to render the manga to the screen, Mamoru Oshi (patlabor 1&2, Jinro...) created a real piece of art! Both the design, story, rythm, animation, drawing and music are absolutly astounding! This is not just a sci-fi movie. It avoids all the ""clichés"" and is more poetic than violent. If I had to keep only one movie, this will be the one.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Yes, I purchased this gumball machine a while ago, but not really until now have I started using it. It is very nice compared to the one's you see for sell at the stores. Most of the one's i've seen have a metal OUTSIDE to make it look 'well made' when the inside in just all plasticy. now this one is going to last you awhile. there's just one little problem -- it says ""it takes all coins"" well, let me tell you, it gets quite jammed when you try putting a dime in there. other than that, I'd say it's pretty nice.. it seems to have it's own stand, but even still, they say you can purchase a bigger one to make it taller.. but I think it'll look strange...

TONE_POLARITY,"For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?",,1

I thought it would be ""hilarious"", but I didn't find it funny in the slightest, in fact it was very boring and empty. It didn't hold my attention, the characters were one dimensional and the writing was oh, so completely bad!I found myself thinking after turning virtually every page, ""what a waste of time this is"". I finally tossed it into my garage sale box after forcing myself to read almost 1/2 of the book.

TONE_POLARITY,"""All is Full of Love"" is a brilliant video in every respect - it's perverse and transcendent at the same time, mixing in humaniform robots with flowing water and hard ceramic - it looks like the future of robot porn.However, what makes me only able to listen to it for brief periods is the menus. Whoever decided that it'd be a good idea to play a hideous cacaphony of every song on the disk, apparently played backwards and at high speed during the menu screens, ought to be horsewhipped for ruining an otherwise good disk. (Even if it is Chris Cunningham.) When the menu screens make you want to take the disk out and throw it out the window, you gotta reconsider the wisdom of doing that.Fortunately, I believe that ""All is Full of Love"" is available on another Bjork video collection, so I'll buy that and sell this one to the local CD/Video concern.-Darren MacLennan",,0

I was expecting to discuss how to use my divorce as a springboard for an authentic, self -actualized life; instead I got lessons in how to put myself in my spouse's shoes, and other words of advice useful in salvaging what's left of the relationship with my spouse. I've done that work, I've agononized over this decision and see my present/future relationship with my spouse as business I have to attend to, in a professional way, as we raise our son. I'm past my spouse, and wish him nothing but the best as we continue to co-parent our son. Divorce will be the catalyst for my extraordinary life, but it will be a life I forge without the help of this book.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I read this book through the complete works of Oswald Chambers. I was frustrated by several commentaries I read that had such a lifeless questionable aim, and finally landed on this book. As the previous preview stated, you get a very solid overview of the book of Ecclesiastes, without a lot of chaff. While nothing is as important as relying on the Holy Spirit to teach and guide us through scripture, there is certainly good in council of the right kind, especially with some of the more difficult books in scripture. There are really a lot of very good and practical lessons in Ecclesiastes, given by one of the wealthiest and wisest men who ever lived (Solomon)...and by the way...I do believe this is a collection of Solomons observations (which unfortunately many spend years arguing about rather than gleaning from his teachings)...go and learn, and see excess and the vanities of life as they really are!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I think it unfair to Ms. Keyes that anyone would compare her to Res, who is so much more womanly and connected to her musical style than Alicia. The Res debut is more cohesive, weaving lyrics and production into a nearly seamless cloth. Even the track listing seems ordered to further your listening pleasure. Aside from the bonus track, which I have to be in the mood for, ""How I Do"" is very much a plug-and-play CD, in contrast to the highly skippable and aptly-titled ""Songs in A Minor"". With Alicia, much as with Aaliyah, there is a disjoint between her startling vocal ability and her production, in Alicia's case an underdeveloped over-synthesized jangle that does nothing to compliment her behind the piano. Alicia's debut is teeny-bop pop and does not reach me on an adult level.I recommend buying Res now and giving Alicia a little time to grow up.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on ""anarcho-syndicalist commune"" and you'll see.You do the maths.

Uplifting, inspiring, terrifying, compelling, tragic, funny, informative, educational--all of those things. I welled up with sadness several times while reading this. Other times my heart swelled with pride for my country and fellow Americans. Durant is a great American. He even has a great sarcastic sense of humor, even in the worst of times. I was laughing out loud at a few of his comments. Read this along with Black Hawk Down and you'll get a great perspective. Never once did I feel that this book was somehow redundant for me after reading BHD.BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!",,1

I bought this album before the first single ""No Such Thing"" was a hit.This album is well written, produced and arranged. Mayer is in top vocal form who keeps being compared to the Dave Matthews Band which is completely false. Mayer has his own style and vocal performance.Songs like ""Neon"" and his latest hit ""Your Body Is A Wonderland"" are in no way the same boring drone of Matthews Band who keep churning album after album out with the same song and sound.Mayer is his own man, with his own style. This album is completely solid through and through. A nice enjoyable treat.Someones review compared him to ""New Kids on the Block""!...Oh please. People like this - you can show them a Monet, then a Velvet Painting of Kids with BIG eyes, and they would see no comparison.This album is a definite recommendation for Adult Contemporary Music.",,1

I think some scenes were too Hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires.

TONE_POLARITY,"John Argue's movement program for reduction of degenerative Parkinson's Disease symptoms is relatable and accessible, allowing almost any general reader to put it into action. Tangible images for movement like the ""horse"" posture and ""picking up a baby"" give readers something to latch onto that will help them mentally and physically integrate the movement. The disease in question, elements that can cure it, and the dynamics of how patients cope with it are incredibly complex - yet Argue manages to deliver beneficial commentary on all three consisely, compellingly, and even joyfully. In addition, the hope in his tone is just as important for patients in healing as the exercises he delivers. For all of these reasons I highly recommend this text for any Parkinson's Disease patient or carer seeking alternative, yet conclusively effective, methods for stemming the progression of this disease.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Everything in this DVD is wonderful--Helen Liang's technique is simply top-notch.

TONE_POLARITY,Diablo 2 is a great improvement on the original Diablo. There is a great depth to the game that much improves on the original storyline of Diablo. There are now four fully populated cities with at least six characters in each who you can trade with and get advice from. Each of the cities has their own problem that you have to solve. You solve the problems by completing the quests given to you by the characters. There is an almost unlimited supply of weapons and armor you get. There are unique and magical items that you can only find once in the game. There is a slight improvement in graphics from the original Diablo. There a five video clips in the game- one before each act and one at the end- which are pretty good but take up allot of hard drive space. A full install of the game will take a little over 1.5 gigs of hard drive.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Don't let the length of this book put you off, it is very well written and a pleasure to read. Starting with the conquest of Britain by Julius Caesar to the present (1997), this book will captivate you all along the way. My only complaint (small at that) is the fact that in the later years (1750 and beyond), the author doesn't spend as much time as in the earlier years and you don't get the same detail and feel as earlier in the book. It is hard at times to follow who's who, but the charts in the front of the book are great aides and despite the fact that chapters often jump hundreds of years, overall the book flows well. Well worth your time!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Ok - I had no idea what this book was about when I picked it up at the library used book sale. I only knew that the cover art was interesting (vaguely Matisse-like café scenes) and that I thought the title was great (I love the word ""Brazen"" - so evocative and sadly underused!). The opening scenes - an accident involving an explosion, flying shrapnel, and a wounded artist - suggested faint hints of The Gargoyle, which I loved. And then I kept reading. And realized I was WAY off. And then I looked the book up online and realized it was French erotic fiction - and then it all made a little more sense. It is a tale of obsession, but falls somewhat flat in both the erotic and the fictional aspects. After a somewhat enjoyable beginning, I rapidly found myself utterly indifferent to the fate of all of the characters and utterly disinterested in their sexcapades. Suffice to say I don't think this one quite lived up to the title - but I still think the title is great!",,0

There is an annotated list of the flowers and ""woody ornamentals,"" such as roses and shrubs, grown by Jefferson. There are many excerpts from his writing and letters which give the reader a greater sense of Jefferson's broad intellect and love of nature as it relates to his gardens. I was hoping to find a list of flowers native to Virginia cultivated by Jefferson but, while the origins of many of the flowers are indicated, there is no separate list of the native plants as I had hoped.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This is a very neat dress watch. I recommend it, despite the comments below. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but was very good value. I may look for something a bit chunkier for sporty outings. The hands and date are easy to read despite the plain dial. The quartering on the dial looks good. I managed to adjust the timne and date without reading the instructionsDifficulties? I struggled to adjust the strap - you need a screwdriver and a good grasp of engineering and the manual is not much use. I initially got the clasp on backwards and also had a lot of difficulty closing the clips. Then when I had the strap the right length I found it quite hard to do the bracelet up. If you buy this (and I hope you will) do practice over a table and do not have the strap very tight - it won't do up like that.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,The information contains in the book makes it a pretty good primer on SIP. The organization of the book and its content is very good. The language and ways in which the author explains certain things are confusing. I think the author should be able to do a much better job in explaining things.

This is an extremely slight book that offers no real insight and says nothing new about any of its subjects -- Transcendental Meditation, the Maharishi, or the Beatles (who appear very little). We learn that practicing TM has benefits but is not a panacea; the Maharishi was not all he was cracked up to be; and celebrities are treated differently than other people (and bigger celebrities more differently still) yet they are human beings too. Stop the presses!The best thing about this book is the photographs, many of which and others can be seen online at www.thebeatlesinindia.com.

Perry Cox and Joe Lindsay gave us a path to enlightenment, and although some of this book's info and its presentation now looks ancient, it was the first step of a stairway that has been climbed by other authors and fans who owe a debt of gratitude to this pioneering work.

When they arrived, I could smell the cologne through the packaging, so I opened it up to see if a bottle broke. Indeed, one bottle had leaked. Even more disconcerting, though, were the bottles themselves. The decorative tops are a cheap, molded plastic. The leaking, cheap bottles simply could not be used as a gift.

Superb thriller is a surprise gem, complete with high-octane suspense and scares. The initially subdued and creepy set-up builds nicely to the last half-hour, a terrifying knockout. Kudos to Steve Zahn for a wonderful performance (he also has good chemistry with Paul Walker) and to John Dahl's taut direction. The film may be a little too elaborate at times with a couple of illogical moments, but you'll be too enthralled to care. Enthusiastically recommended.",,1

It is a SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE parody! Okay?!?! All the Star Wars fans who dissed this film for making ""hackneyed Star Wars references"" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not STAR WARS references, they are references to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. It doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of Star Wars fans haven't seen or even know what SHAKESPEARE is about. I guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh?

After another professor is killed, Jill finds that she herself might be next.

The scenery and colors, the camera angles, have those new(at the time) 60's camera angles, some reminiscent of the American series ""Batman"".

TONE_POLARITY,"As someone who generally appreciates good writing, I looked forward to reading this collection. It only left me infuriated. Updike is an amazing writer. He truly knows the art and beauty of the craft. But all of his stories belie his misogyny. Men resent their wives, women are portrayed in one or two negative ways--it ruined the whole book for me. So I switched to Flannery O'Connor instead. Good writing, no misogyny.",,0

My first unit had to be returned as the power button would not stay on. My second unit operates properly but there are multiple quality issues. The espresso is weak despite multiple attempts and variations of grind and tamping pressure. The unit advertises that it heats water for making tea - but it only heats to 165-180 degrees - not hot enough for tea. I have contacted Cuisinart by phone and email to see if they have any suggestions and have received no responses. All in all, a very disappointing purchase. I have had good experiences with Cuisinart products in the past but will probably never buy another.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard.

I'm a beginning programmer who knows a lot about C, but not everything, and this book isn't helping me at all.

TONE_POLARITY,I have never really been fond of Ethics and Moral code to begin with because most of the articles fail to realize the whole point of what they are writing about. This book really wasn't any different. The articles about Abortion are weak and they don't fully explain what their whole point of what they are writing about is. It doesn't help matters when every article in this book is so drawn out. Everything that is said in this book could be done so in about 2 or 3 pages instead it is drawn out to about 10 to 15 pages. The authors are basically repeating themselves over and over throughout the entire article.I personally don't think this would be a great buy but maybe thats because I find all the arguments in moral and ethic philosophies are very weak and not at all to the point.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel.

Nor did I get much farther. I was at a friend's house on a sleepover and brought this little novel along to fill in the dull moments, but the moments remained dull even with I'm Telling. Try as I might, I could not force my way into this book. I tried skipping some chapters and jumping into the middle, but that didn't work any better. The story was heavy, overdone, and sluggish. Perhaps I just need more action and less description of small feelings and details, but this one felt suffocating and after finally coming up for air, I did not go back.",,0

It is the best PSP game I have, and I have at least 10, and have played many more. The controls are AWESOME, the storyline and characters are CLASSIC, and overall it feels like you're playing a classic Western film as Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. The details get pretty gorey, though, with brain splatter, blood squirting, and dismemberment, so it's not for the faint of heart. The one thing that could be better is the length of the game.

Either I read the book hype wrong or else I have mis-judged Mr. Cruz Smith's ability as a writer. Except for the excerpts by established time honored writers: Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Guy de Maupassant, I find the book mundane, deplorable and a disappointment that Mr. Cruz Smith attached his name to it. I found bad usage of grammar, stories that lost the development of the plot, confusion of character identification (Frederick ?)and just poor mystery writing overall.Amaturism personified.

TONE_POLARITY,"I am not a gamer at all, but my husband got addicted to this game and insisted I try it. It is really a fun game! The programmers who made it must be tops in their field because there are very few glitches or bugs and the game-play is very intuitive. The detail is just amazing - from stars in the sky to footprints on the ground, they haven't left out any little thing. You really become part of this imaginary world.Even though a large part of this game involves killing members of the other faction as well as various other computer-generated beasts, this is not a mean-spirited game. It's difficult to be successful unless you team up with others and cooperate. I have seen a lot of very altruistic, helpful, and generous behavior from other players. There are always a few dorks around, too, of course, but for the most part this game seems to bring out the chivalry in its players. I'd recommend this game for age 13 and up.",,1

He teams up with the young Paige Mitchell who helps spice up the plot a bit with undertones of innocent sexuality. This reviewer did find the Paige Mitchell character's usuage of the term, ""Kay-O"" (ie: okay), to be a bit annoying and over used. Overall, I'd rate the book as a great read, however.",,1

I would suggest taking less time weaving a frayed ""fantastic plot"" and more time with actual character and story development.",,0

It was an intersting experience, accidentally, because reading it without the last chapter made one confront the basic construct of the tale. It seemed incomplete after chapter two, but complete after chapter three. What was the missing element? The female character of absorption and empathy. So, I am glad that the compilation is a complete disaster, as it forced me to confront what this particular short story is really about: female human-ness vs male ego driven self-delusion.""Washington Square"" is the only truly great work in the collection.

I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this storage tower years ago.Unfortunately, the other reviewers are correct.This product was a waste of money as it seems to always tip over if I were to completely fill the slots with cd's.I'm sure the other consumers purchased this because of its sleek appearance.

TONE_POLARITY,"The pain of getting it set up is well worth the price. After 4 phone calls to ATTBI's tech support, it works great! 3 of 4 tech support peeps kept telling me I needed to pay [the money] to have someone come out and install it. THIS IS [NONSENSE]! Finally one of the tech supporters knew what to do: Simply register the cable modem at their online site...Make sure you register your computer with your current modem, then register your 3com modem. If you don't reg your 3com modem at that site, you'll get slow speeds (~100k instead of 1.5M). Like I said, the only trouble I had getting this modem set up was with attbi's tech support. Once I found someone who know what they were talking about, it went smoothly. Plus [buying] the modem sure beats [the] lease fee!! :)",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"One of the best things about LPs, as opposed to CDs, was the ability to flip the sleeves in stores during browsing. I started listening to jazz in the early 1980's, and was rapidly transfixed by the beauty and originality of the artwork on releases from the ECM jazz label, out of Germany. Since 1970, ECM has released nearly 700 albums of wonderful music, much of which defies categorization. What remains is their clearly identifiable (but often imitated - such as by Windham Hill) cover graphic style, making their releases art collector items as well as music. This book describes the history of the ECM sleeve art, as well as provides color pictures of essentially all of their releases up to the publication date of the book. This book is a wonderful gift to music, as well as art, lovers!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"JRB is one of my heroes! He did an awesome job adapting the story of Leo Frank to music quite fitting of the South while adding his usual Jewish tinge to it. I love 'All the Wasted Time'- one of the best musical theatre duets in the past 50 years, as well as 'This is Not Over Yet'- a tour de force piece of work. Pretty much everything in this book is wonderful. It will definitely take either an extremely talented classical pianist and/or a strong reader in chords and feel for the songs to play a lot of these accompaniment parts, but they are some of the most enjoyable songs to play. My only reason I am giving the songbook 4 stars is because it doesn't have 'There is A Fount/God This Don't Make Sense' in here. I figured out most of it by ear with the cd, but still it would have been nice to have included this heartfelt eulogy to Mary Phagan in here. Oh well, I guess you can't get them all.

TONE_POLARITY,"In writing this review, I have focused purely on the music rather than the band composition and have not compared this to other albums. I think any album or compilation has to be taken in isolation and in this, DST stands out as an extremely well composed and engineered album. What I like about this album is its brooding and almost smoky feel, particularly when you listen to it on cloudy, rainy days, when you are just a bit blue and when you dont want something heavy going on in the background. Pick this album, put it in your CD changer and let it loop, and watch the music grow on you. The soothing bass and the mellow guitating gets you going. Get your rare scotch out and pour yourself a couple and let the heady combination take you to stratosphere!!",,1

That is to say, it has a good range of features and is very flexible, capable of producing anything to which you set your mind.However... because of the depth of features, it can be INCREDIBLY difficult to use at first, and even the simplest tasks can take an age to perform if you aren't fluent with the software!! In that respect, it scores low for ease of use, but since it is probably not intended for the amateur user, it would be unfair to let this count against it.Don't be intimidated by this -it'll become easy once you've done a few tutorials, and once you've mastered it the world is your oyster- but be prepared to have learn first!",,1

Skaarsgard does make a pretty convincing younger version of Father Merrin, some 25 years before the events in the first Exorcist, and like Father Karras, has his own crisis of faith from his WWII days as a priest in Nazi Europe. As mentioned by others, some of the CGI effects could be better (the hyeanas, the sandstorm), but overall I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it.",,1

I would definitely NOT recommend these for outdoor running/walking/biking because they allow so little outside noise in. However, for the gym, the office, the library, etc, they are great.

And the few times she actually sings her songs, you are almost relieved for her and for the fans that paid to see the concert. She rambles on and on in between songs and although she truly seems to love her fans and want to involve them, she does not reward them with well sung music.All that being said, it was watchable, but then again, a train wreck is possible too.",,0

There is so much information one could get bogged down in, especially in the past century of architecture, but Wodehouse and Moffett charge on ahead without becoming stuck.

Pink Floyd, yes; Air, yes; Radiohead's Kid A -- most definitely. Like that album, this one maintains a somber mood throughout, adding sustained keyboard chords and echoey guitar to mostly murmured vocals. There are less electronic beats here than on Kid A, but they do appear on a couple of the instrumentals. Overall the album is a bit too sleepy for my tastes, with few strong melodies, and it certainly doesn't add much to what Radiohead already added to Pink Floyd.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"UPDATED NOV 22 2009DOWN TO ONLY 1 STAR - PIECE OF JUNK .... BUT THE BATTERY LIFE SEEMS FINE. It just has so little suction and the wet pad idea is just a dirty mess maker. I use it for light (I mean really light) dust-busting, but it is not shaped or designed for just that, so I can't even use it as an effective dust-buster except for a few spots around the house.DO NOT RECOMMEND.I was pleased with the quick light cleaning at first. However over time, it really turned out to be much less useful than I first thought.The suction is terrible and the cleaning pads are a mess. Taking off the dirty ones, washing and replacing makes the whole thing problematic.The pads are attached with velcro and stretch and wear poorly when washed. Thus they do not fit that well once used and washed several times, and the velcro has it's own typical loss of adhesion after constant use.THUMBS DOWN in the long run.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I've had my Observer since 2002. It's been with me from the depths of La Jolla Cove to the heights of Pike's Peak. The functions are all very cool and it's a great looking watch.HOWEVER: There are many times that the watch has sat in my desk drawer waiting for parts while my G-Shock and Timex IronMan carry the load. Today is one of those times. The Observer's wrist strap breaks every 18-24 months - and that occurs even with preventative maintenance on the band on a weekly basis. The replacement straps cost $40. My straps have broken for the 4th time. So, if you think that a $20/year cost of ownership on top of the price of the watch is a good bargain, then get this watch.

TONE_POLARITY,"Judging an author's body of work by only reading one novel, and her last novel written at the very end of her long life, is infantile, the equivalent of watching Steven Spielberg's ""1941"" and judging him to be a mediocre talent and not worthy of further viewing.This is Mrs Thirkell's final completed novel and like the majority of her later works, not up to the standards of her finest work of the Thirties and Forties, but it's a must read for fans of the Barsetshire series. For newcomers to her books, I would recommend any of the Barsetshire novels of the Thirties, but particularly ""Summer Half"", ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Pomfret Towers"", ""The Brandons"" or ""High Rising"". These early novels can be read as stand alones that introduce the characters featured throughout the series and are witty, dry, well-written comedies of manners.",,0

Their complaint was that the dvd seemed to make up alien creatures and it was founded on nothing. They thought that anybody could make up whatever they wanted about aliens.

The crinkly stuff still works, even three washes later.I am not fond of the mirror.

Way too many tragedies for one family to endure. The acting is superb, not just Bobby's character, but Tom Wilkinson and Greg Kinnear were spectacular and robbed from critical acclaim.

TONE_POLARITY,"C.A.Harday, a reviewer below, got a little carried away in her negative review of this book, but I agree with her basic criticism. This is a Christian book with Bible citations throughout. I stopped reading when I realized the author's obvious bias. When I'm looking for information on immune system health, I'm not looking for highly-biased presentations on religion. My bias isn't against Christianity per se, it's including Christianity without fully disclosing that personal bias nor making a connection between that personal bias and the supposed educational material of the book. The author needs to be more open and honest, or she needs to leave her personal religion out of her desire to ""educate"" about health. She quickly burned her credibility with me.A better book is 4 Weeks to Maximum Immunity: Disease-Proof Your Body by the editors of Prevention Magazine (2008)",,0

No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault.

First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap.

This is defintely a case of ""not standing up to the test of time"". Having seen many variations of super hero cartoons over the years, I now think these are horrible. Actually, kinda laughable.

TONE_POLARITY,"I picked-up a 10"" Wushtof Chef (the one on this page) and a 6"" Chef when I was in Germany and I love them. The 10"" is large enough that you can cut large items and also has a wider blade that helps with ""proper"" chopping technique for those of us who are not ""professionals"". Of course, the wider blade also allows you to scoop-up a good amount of ingredients for transfer to where-ever you need them.Even for being such a large blade, the knife is light, balanced and easy to handle. I anticipate that these knives will last me a lifetime if properly cared for (for example, I always use the honing rod before use which will help prevent the need for sharpening). I recommend these knives to everyone I know who enjoys cooking even the least bit and I feel it's better to have a few well-selected quality knives than one of those ""sets"" of cheapies (most of which are filled with blade styles you'll never use anyway).",,1

It has some good laughs, but considering the talent of Conway and Korman, it really should havebeen a lot better.In They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way Tim Conway and Chuck McCann are a couple of bumbling cops that are sent by the governor intoa prison farm to find out where an old man hide his loot from a robbery. And with Dub Taylor as the warden and Richard Kiel (Jawsfrom the James Bond movies) as the intimidating bad guy it makes for some good laughs.Like I said, these are not Conway`s best movies, but there are some good laughs in them and well worth watching.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Pretty nice product. I don't have a lot of experience with ""regular"" kettlebells, so it is tough to do a direct comparison, but this set up works pretty well so far. It does seem to have the feel of regular kettlebells. I haven't gotten to really heavy weights, so can't comment on how bulky it may get with bigger weight loads. The construction is solid, but I would agree with a previous review that it seems a bit expensive for what I would think it would cost to make. It does look like it will last a while. Buying or finding standard weights is not a problem, they are fairly cheap and can be found at yard sales, craigslist, ect. Overall, as it has allowed me to start and progress through 2 levels of weights, and the money I have spent on the handle and weights is still less than what I would have spent on buying a starter bell and then having to trade up.",,1

I don't really see this manga going anywhere...pros: the art is nice and simple and the characters are distinguishable from each other.overall, an overrated manga.

That said, I don't like this book much because the text is so painfully BAD - awkward and horrible rhyming, poor cadence, truly not fun to read aloud. I can't believe anyone would publish such awful writing!Also, the front pouch has never worked quite right.

I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days.",,0

You tend to want to compare it to Michael Keaton's 'Clean and Sober', but in reality there is no comparison which is disappointing. All in all a very forgetable film.

Just Actors and Directors patting each other on the back.If you want to see a film that explores this type of content with a little more realism and understanding of a complex subject, purchase Clean & Sober.",,0

Seeing them put to terminology that I can use was so very helpful, and his willingness to be vulnerable and talk about his own history helps a reader to feel invested in the work he's doing.

Several of them get the attacker in trouble. And then let him out. Others make contact and take control. And then give up both. There are, G-d help us, pictures of him kicking the knife out of the attacker's hand and others where he exposes things most of us REALLY don't want cut to the blade.Save your money.

Nonetheless its sheer stupidity kept me turning the pages.Upon reading this book, I was struck by the ignorance of this author. Not only does this short novel lack any coherent structure, but also is a sour attempt at humor. I can understand that Bush's face looks like a chimp's, but joking about how he has been switched at birth for a ""hairless chimpanzee"" is unimaginative and banal. My question is, ""who cares?"" If you want to chastise a political leader, why not do so intelligently, citing resources and using facts to back up your claims. Quotes used out of context don't cut it.A very unhappy read.

I was truly disappointed by the sound of this - it is the aural equivalent of mud and cotton, very mushy, hard to make out the details, and not something I really want to deal with. The conducting seems particularly heavy handed, as if the conductor wanted to make a name for himself by making his own slight alterations to the piece that, while not significant, are unnecessary and very irritating. Poor recording technique and a wierd performance, but wait! There's a warning on the label that the cannons are very loud!! Oh my, then this MUST be the recording to get to show off a [amt.] stereo in the bachelor pad - maybe the cannons will be so loud that your date will hop right into your lap!This is to classical music what a primer-grey muscle car is to a show of luxury automobiles.",,0

All the slow ""love songs"" are written by the man himself, there are also some uptempos ongs he had some help on. One thing youll hear on this CD is the meaningful words, but the chords, vocals, instruments, EVRYTHING. It will capture your mind, when u hear Brians Vocals on ""6,8,12"" u know that it cant get any better, then you hear the breakdown on ""Shall We Begin"" smooth....as silk. But dont leave out the 5 uptempo songs where it can get no better, in my opion way better than ""You should be Mine"". Overall this album is much better than his ""Anytime"" album which had a bit more hip-hop/pop sound to it. The only reson it does get only 4 stars is becuse i dont know what Mr. McKnight will deliver next...can it get better? Im just not sure - Ray Roa",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"A must for those who are familiar with Luria's works, Assessment of Cognitive Processes is a wonderful book, explaining the best intelligence theory to date: the PASS theory of intelligence. Focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the PASS stands for Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive processes. I use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. The PASS Remedial Pogram (PREP) who stand for PASS Reading Enhancement Program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop Succesive and Simultaneous strategies. A wonderful addition to the field. If you are a cognitive psychologist or a school psychologist and do a lot of work with children this is the right book for and introduction to remedial instruction",,1

You have to really push the thing and go over things many times in order for anything to get picked up - even something as simple as a bit of paper from a spiral-bound notebook's torn edge. Also, the design placing the roller brush in the very center of the head is unfortunate and makes it so that you can't get it to do anything near walls/edges unless you can move the sweeper with its sides up against them (I would expect the roller to be in the frontal part, not the center).Anyway - doesn't work for me.

One of her friends played with it for about 5 minutes and broke or lost all of the parts (just the nature of the toy, not the child). My daughter could have cared less. No big surprise here. The reviews are on base as they usually are. And, the crown for the child is a joke. The 2 crowns are too big for a the horse and literally half the size of a child's head. Mattel had great commerials for this and Santa probably delivered a pile of these. However, I bet Santa didn't deliver anything to those Mattel Executives!

I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a student could pick up relevant aspects of compuatational plasticity from this book; the book has a style of its own. We have successfully used the book in programming the integral (or endochronic) hardening rule with the incremental theory of plasticity.

While it is set in 1920's Illinois, this book resonates perhaps 50 years into the future, and into the past. Alas, I fear that it may resonate very faintly in these ""post-modern"" times. Still, if your life is rooted in that Golden-Age of small-town, heartland America, you will recognise these scenes, these characters, these feelings. Bradbury is a writer, a poet actually, of the heart and of feelings. Indeed, before I read him I didn't have the understanding or the patience to read poetry. Afterwards I did. He opened me up to subtle things.When I see people critisizing his style as rambling or flowery, I can see that they just don't get it.

TONE_POLARITY,"First off, I love this movie. It's one of my favorite movies of all time and I thought the first dvd release was excellent. This dvd has the same exact special features as that one. So why do we need this ""special edition""? So that Universal studios can make more money because they believe that no one will buy it unless it's a new release. To me there is no point in doing a re-release if nothing but the sound changes from the previous edition.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I managed to get through 45% of this book before I realized I would rather set my hair on fire (if I had any) than go back and read any more.So far, at 45%, there was no story. There were characters by the dozens, each with a contrived space type name like:Yelena Bugolubovo,Nierbog,Veblen, etc etc.Some of them were described with square heads, and some were huge, from other planets all settling on this space city.I was so frustrated by ill-defined characters, and the number of them without giving me a picture for my mind to grasp, that I had had enough/Maybe there's a story line, you know; good guys vs bad guys somewhere later on, but a book, a play, a movie, should entertain.This book missed the mark for me.You can obtain it at no cost, but that's about what it's worth in my humble opinion.Sorry to be so strong about it, but honesty is better than false diplomacy.Fred Auerbach",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks, which I've used for about 20 years. In fact, I used it so much that it was falling apart so I ordered a new one for myself, and then one for a friend as a gift.What I like so much: It's arranged as complete meals, usually 2-3 recipes per meal. Then there are directions for what order to do things in, so everything gets done at about the same time. Mostly very healthy recipes, with calorie counts. And in addition to all that, every meal either takes less than 30 minutes, or you can make it ahead and freeze it.Marian Burros rocks!",,1

When I ordered the Bananas & Cherries I was hoping they would be crispy and crunchy like the apples, but the texture was completely different. The chewy cherries are OK, but the bananas are really tough to chew. With the apples I'm satisfied with one bag, but with the bananas and cherries it takes two bags. I'm sorry I didn't stick with the apples. I was really disappointed. If I had read the reviews first I probably wouldn't have ordered them. Live and learn.",,0

What a major disappointment - you'd expect that product from such a major manufacturer would have parts available everywhere, first class support, web site with all kinds of information - well... forget it! This telephone uses very unique power supply - 6VAC there is no way to find it anywhere. Manufacturer's web site is utterly useless. Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked? I know one thing - I won't take chances and stay clear of this manufacturer's line of products.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this album as it featured constantly in critics fave lists over the years (especially remember reading about Dreamer in a Desert Island Collection by Australian music critic Stuart Coupe in an ex-girlfriend's magazine one lazy afternoon). Bobby sings like no-one else. He has this growl that at first seems out of place - it's so unexpected. But he puts such feeling into building up each tune - no song of his starts on high emotion - Bobby likes the slow burn, you dig? When I play his music for my friends they think it's someone having a laugh - sort of like comedian Lenny Henry doing his Theo T Wildebeast routine (especially going by the photos in the jacket too - they're in a classic pimp style). But to true lovers of soul you can tell that Mr Bland is the real thing. Defintitely worth a listen.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I love Conrad, so I was very disappointed when I read (or slogged through) LORD JIM. Conrad was heavily under the influence of Henry James when he wrote this book, and if you like Henry James, then you'll probably like this one. But, as Michael Crichton said about Henry James, ""I can't stand Henry James. His stuff reads like a first draft."" Conrad writes like Henry James here in that the sentences are eternal and convoluted, and take forever to make a point. And every little thing in LORD JIM is symbolic of...you name it: man's despair, etc. As I said, I love Conrad: HEART OF DARKNESS, NOSTROMO, his short stories. But I found LORD JIM a totally unwelcome change in his writing style, and it was pure tedium for me to make it to the last page",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Well, this looks nothing like the review I wrote at the time I bought the reel. I used to be a big penn fan, but now I'm sticking with shimano or maybe even branching out and trying some other brands. This reel is not all that smooth and doesn't really cast that well for the price. It's probably comparable to most $30-50 reels at best in my mind. The rest of the price is for the name, which it seems has become the selling point of these reels over the actual quality. The screw that holds the bail on this reel broke in half and the reel is basically worthless to me now unless I can find a way to get the broken off part out and feel like spending $5-10 on a new screw from Penn. Already bought a $30 shimano to get me by for the time being and I'm not sure it wasn't at least an even trade. Disappointing product to carry the Penn name.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Whether you have a shiny new mountain bike or one that has been on more than a few trail rides, this book is a must to have in your collection. For about [price] and the price of some tools you'll be able to perform the most common maintenance on your bike yourself. Not only will this save you money (tuneups aren't exactly cheap these days), but you'll understand your equipment much better and be able to handle unexpected situations on the trail.The book is a large format with two columns of text per page and hand drawn figures (basically no photos). Each part of the bike is covered in great depth in pseudo-outline form.The only downside is that the figures can be a bit difficult to understand. I can see how they can be more clear that photos, but some combination of the two or perhaps just more figures would have helped. I've found it is always best to look at the figures alongside my bike so there is no ambiguity.",,1

If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read.

I saw the preview of this DVD on Last Exile (which is a pretty cool series) I was attracted by the excellent detailed animation in the 2 minute preview. I couldn't find a review on it so I went and bought it. Unfortunately all this movie has going for it is the animation. Which personally I think is superb! The story is sorely lacking and the translation must be way off, Heck I don't speak a word of japanese but I can even tell I was missing more to the story. There is no explanation to any of the characters nor why they are there except there deamons attacking Japan. No explanation on the demons at all. Plus the movie seems skip alot from scene to scene without explaing any of the event. To top it off you have an ending that makes no sense. You don't even know what exactly is happening. I advise just to rent it and if you do put it on mute and just look at the eye candy.",,0

He imagines a molecule-for-molecule identical copy of himself that lacks conscious experience, and then says that because it's logically possible to imagine it, there must be something other than molecules responsible. My problem is that he is jumping the gun. We don't know the brain well enough yet.

The canister unit finally leaked too badly to use any more, and the portable has loose heads that prevent you from controling the spray effectively. This unit works great and the heads are stable so you can aim at a specific area or tooth. The only downside is it's consumption of batteries.

TONE_POLARITY,"As much as I would like to stand up for Lauren and say, ""No, this was a well written novel!"" I just can't. The simple reason is that it isn't. It was initially entertaining but so incredibly inconsistent throughout. Andrea's character had no depth, you did not find yourself feeling for her or becoming connected to her in any way. Anyone who tolerates this type of abuse, in my opinion, deserves it. I am not quite sure how Ms. Weisberger wanted you to feel about her main character.

TONE_POLARITY,On one phone I can talk for an hour and a half and the other for an hour before it goes dead. I MUST place it back on the charger after every use or I will not have a phone.

TONE_POLARITY,There are two ways of looking at Harry Potter. You either love him or you hate him. Obviously the author of this book hates Harry Potter. I decided to read this book with an open mind and I have to disagree with what the author is saying. While it's obvious that the author is sincere this is not a particularly good book. The writing is stiff and many of the conclusions make no sense. The author's near hysteria made it difficult for me to take him seriously.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,There was a pile of free books at my school and this book was in that pile. I took it because I like to see what students used to read. My mother was trying to find the publication date and then saw that the book is for white children. It had racist slurs but I think given that the book was written in 1956 it may have been used in a private school. I read some parts and its an easy read for beginners I was just shocked with some of what was written.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,I gave this gift to my husband for christmas. It is terrible. We can only get one station and even then it has too much static on it. It does work great if hooked up to cable but then again so would any tv. No matter where we went we only got one channel and it was in spanish. No helpful to us since we don't speak the language. I returned the item.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this sharpener for very cheap and soon learned why. The pencil got sharp, but the motor almost quit trying to do it. It looks nice, sleek, kinda like a mouse.

TONE_POLARITY,"I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I love Marc Anthony's vocal range and passion, and I've been waiting to hear the follow-up to his outstanding English-language debut CD. ""Mended"" doesn't come anywhere close to what he delivered the first time. There's enough regurg music out there! Don't submerge this extraordinary voice with lukewarm arrangements. Perhaps for the next album Marc will corroborate with the great team he worked with on the first one. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I initially enjoyed this show but as I watched it, I found that it was repetitive and difficult to swallow. So many of the items that come in on this show are just not believable as just popping up for some pawn broker to buy.

TONE_POLARITY,"I love this little speaker. Compared to the little one my son bought at Radio Shack, it has unbelievable sound quality. However, I paid only $17 on a Gold Box deal, so I am taking that into consideration. I would never pay retail, altho' some of you might think it is worth it to get this kind of bass. It is completely portable which makes my ipod so much more useable both in the car & at home. The only thing I am unhappy with is that no A/C adaptor is included. However, my husband said A/C adaptors are easy to get, so once I have that, you won't hear one more complaint from me.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As a psychotherapist, I am always interested in self-help books that might be valuable to myself and my clients. This book, along with Scott Wexzler's book, ""Living with the Passive-Agressive Man,"" are the two books I continually recommend to those people who feel angry and ""crazy"" in relationships and yet don't quite understand what is going on. This book is especially valuable because not only does the author define passive-aggressive behavior, he gives concrete ideas of how to constructively recognize and address it. Also, he provides a realistic assessment of the effects p/a has on a relationship and the difficulty one will have in recognizing and disengaging from this anger. Well written and easy to follow, this book is a valuable asset to anyone caught up in the tentacles of passive aggressive, or hidden, anger.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,Another reviewer wrote that this worked well with Kindle's seach feature. But when I tried to search for a word it told me that this book is not set up for searching. Maybe one of the other editions is. I'm glad I only paid 99 cents.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"It is obvious some fans have completely mistaken this set for a budget CD released in the mid-90's, one which displayed re-makes in favor of the originals. That set was done to side-step contractual troubles regarding rights to material, as ARS was trying to re-establish itself in the mid 90s. While the remakes are a curious listen, this 1991 Polydor collection does tremendous justice to a wonderful group. I can't top Kevin's great review seen in these pages, so this was mainly to clear up the misunderstanding about the bogus best-of. True, the new Millenium set has superior sound, but a very short track list. I would still spring for the 91 edition, as it is solid top to bottom...artwork included. :)",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This movie seems to have gone un-noticed by many people, but we think it is a worthy, though a little old fashioned, suspenseful entertainment. Lee Remick is so lovely, and Rod Steiger shows off his love of the stage. We give it 4 thumbs up.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I couldn't find clay targets anywhere so I looked online and found them here. The targets were exactly what I was looking for but I expected to get a lot of broken clays as I had read in other reviews. Sure enough I did. I only received about 40 of the 90 clays intact. I was able to salvage about 5 others that had simple breaks that I could glue back together with ease. Still, the shipping costs greatly decreased the value of the clays and then only half the clays surviving transport made the value even worse. I will still search out clay targets but I will not have them (at least this brand) shipped to me again.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I decided to give this movie a try and was ready to turn it off within 15 minutes. Christina can really sing but she can't act. I was disappointed in Cher. I have always enjoyed her movies but I have to say the acting in this movie was terrible. No chemistry. The musical numbers were ok but after a while, they too began to get on my nerves.

Great acting, great music, great sound, great action, and it is the best movie ever made. I know you won't think that but that's what I think. There is no way that you can't ignore this movie. It just makes you want to scream out ""SPIELBERG, YOU ARE A GENIUS!"" I would recommend this movie to people over 14 years of age, who likes Spielberg films, and who likes to watch war films. After you watch the movie, you have to clap and cheer at the end. This is one of those films you have to see. No dought about it.",,1

They have influences both from King Crimson and classical music (featurin John Wetton performing Starless) and a short ""Frank Zappa Hommage"". In my opinion, this is one of biggest band in the Prog. scene, compared whit giants like The flower kings , Transatlantic or Spock's Beard... the first time you hear teir music it can be difficult to ""understand"" it, but if you relax, kick your shoes off and taste some good wine you can really enjoy it and let your mind fly away, so you can visit places that you only can go in dreams... sit down and enjoy this beatifull music.",,0

The Mic would not pick up anything so I sent them back and tried another pair and the samething happened. So, now I need to find a different headset. These don't come with any drivers to install so it's just a windows generic type setting. I think if they had some install program and some drivers it might have been a different story. They are comfortable and the sound is great but if you can't be heard, what's he point. I think cyber acoustics is a good company and produces a good headset but they missed the mark this time.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The eighties had to be a hard time for bands, music like everything else was changing and Kiss went right along with that and tried to do something original, and they did it.Fans may not like it, and later they changed back to the original sound, but if you listen to this album, which i like by the way, you hear the influences they had on later to come bands.Some guitar riffs and styles i can hear in later Bowie sounds, also bands like Journey,Boston etc. ,and i can even hear a little of the mid eighties Joan Jett.So while it may have been not to fans liking, it was innovative for what it is.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,This is the first mp3 player i have used/purchased. I am very happy with it. I love the size of it and it holds enough music for my needs. The software that it comes with has been easy to work with. I find it takes a while to convert wav files to mp3 or wma files but that is fine. But it does not take long to gt the mp3 files on the player.This is a good player with not to many extras youcan adjust the bass and treb and it has repet and random but that is about it.

TONE_POLARITY,"Anne Rice fans will find much that is familiar in ""Cry to Heaven"", although unlike her other popular novels, there is no element of the supernatural present here. This is a book that will transport the reader back to 18th century Italy, into a world of politics, intrigue, corruption, and most of all, music. Rice's writing is as full and rich as always, with detailed settings and fully realized characters. The novel is well-researched, I learned much about the time period that I didn't know before.The flaw? I found most of the major plot twists to be extremely predictable. I won't give anything away, but every time something shocking happened, I had already guessed what was to come at least a chapter before. Maybe I've just read too many books. Regardless, I would still recommend this book to any Anne Rice fan.",,1

I bought this used through Amazon.com and it is a recording of a live broadcast from Dresden in 1992. The performance includes only three of the six cantatas that make up the Christmas Oratorio. The performance is lackluster and the video is fuzzy, having been converted to NTSC from the European PAL video system. The audio has a strange tapping noise heard between numbers. The harpsichord gets increasingly out of tune as the performance goes on. Someone bought this video when a public library dumped it and has foisted it off onto unsuspecting Internet buyers. The best performance on video is conducted by Beringer and includes all six cantatas and no strange noises.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"As a psychologist with 20+ years experience, I am less than enamored with Peter Levine's work, and here's why:I realize lately that through many ""brief therapy"" approaches, both therapists and clients are looking for quick answers to rather complex problems. Those of us who have traditionally done longer term therapy already knew that it wasn't so easy. We also knew - or at least should know if we want to offer hope - that humans have an innate drive toward health, in spite of ""trauma."" When Levine points out the complexity of trauma, even as an em-bodied experience, he takes a ""radical"" approach - but really nothing new. Now many therapists and clients are ""discovering"" the baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. I give Levine credit for re-opening our eyes, but, frankly, this in not new material. Real growth producing therapy is a broad endeavor, not a six session ""technique""....",,0

Once again, Dereske gives us a fast-paced thriller that's hard to put down.

Spike interigating them with a Boba Fett action figure is priceless, as is the Millenium Falcon painted on the side of their covert ops van (With a horn that plays the Star Wars theme). Buy this season for the brilliant musical episode, ""Once More, With Feeling"" and stay for the evil Willow story arc which ends the season.

TONE_POLARITY,This cat toy is FANTASTIC! I don't think there is a single cat out there that can resist it. My two cats lunged at it in about two seconds as soon as I gave the ball a little shove to get their attention. They played with it together for about ten minutes straight and it was so amusing to watch them really get all energized over this toy jumping and slapping the ball to each other. They come play with it every time I pull it from the corner of the room.The cat scratcher middle is fantastic as well. I don't have a scratching post so when ever they start getting frisky and clawing my upholstered chairs I just slide out the scratcher and they immediately use that instead! Fantastic toy ...buy one for yourself and any friends who may have a sweet feline!I've had mine since August 2010 and im now on to the second side of the scratching card in case you're wondering if to get extras. You'll have some happy cats with this one!,,1

The movie however is disappointing.I felt all actors played their role adequately.It's just a little too mixed culture for me.The storyline is rather limited.It's like a dramatic comedy with a few laughs and lot of church. I didn't know what to expect.I heard someone say it's funny.I'm sorry cause this will go down as the one Tom Hanks film I don't recommend to anyone.Anyhow,watch this movie only if you're as stubborn as me and must see every movie by Mr.Hanks.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"i bought this Bender head for $107 with my tax refund. best decision ever :P haha. it is a great bender head. the little antenna is in a little area right above it so if u keep it in the box you can't see it, but i recommend that you do keep it in the box so it can look like those heads with the water in them. plus its a cool box to keep. the dvd's do sometimes get stuck so i just decided to put them in a cd case holder and put the head on dislplay. the reason i gave it four instead of five stars was cause the dvd's get stuck and because sometimes its a little hard to open the Bender head. it includes all the episodes and movies! i really love it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I absolutely love this cast cover. Super easy to use and shower with confidence.I spent three months in a cast and started with everyone's recommended trashbag. I did get the great idea to use saran wrap instead of tape and it was ok, but after the shower it was wet and messy. I read reviews on other items and saw things about how hard it was to put the covers on or that they broke after a couple uses. I didn't have any of that with this product.I wasn't sure what size to pick so I might have gone a bit larger than I needed but it worked out fine. The air pump makes it so that even if you do buy large it is suctioned to the right size - you just have a little extra material. It stretched easily over my cast and was easy to take off after.It was a little expensive, but worth every penny.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this DVD with some misgivings, but accepted the earlier, favourable reviews.Am happy with the stage settings and the music. Columbara, as Roger, is the pick of the cast, but the other males are all very acceptable without being great.Unfortunately, Veronica Villaroel does not appeal to me. Her higher range is tentative, unsteady and I wondered at times if she was confident that she had hit the right note.Despite this I give the performance four stars as everything else was enjoyable.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I read all the Bed and Breakfast books and I generally LOVE them all - I don't really know what it was but I felt like I was just really getting tired of Judith sticking her nose into things the twist was nice and I cannot wait till the next book - but it was a major downfall to her last book and to all the previous titles in this series. I think maybe there just wasn't enough Rene in it for me -,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this 2 years ago when I had my first daughter. I used it in her stroller on cool days and could quickly install it on the jogger when going for a run at the beach (where it's usually windy and cooler during the fall). It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. I am now using the same bundle me with my second child. I'd recommend it to anyone who spends lots of time outdoor taking walks, etc.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The only difference between Penthouse Forum and Kleins rag of a book is that neocons more rabidly use the latter for jacking material. Klein has been proven to be a money grubbing shill for the right wing and has admitted as much. But keeping up the pretense that this is a book of 'non-fiction' and not merely a money making scheme for Klein is simply revolting. It is poorly researched, rehashed fictions designed to maintain the polarization of this country and make Ed Klein a buck. This thing has been vilified by even Hannity and OReilly. Flies linger on dogshi+ because they are tired and feel dirty from having landed on Kleins 'book'.I urge you to move this book to the fiction shelves whenever you see it in a bookstore, or recommend to the employees that they do so.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The problem with the Atlantis supplement was that Palladium didn't give us the level of description for the the cities of Atlantis like they did for the Vampire Kingdoms. Yes, there were more cities to keep track of, but the magic continent had much more promise.The NGR supplement redeems Palladium. They don't give you layouts of cities like Ciudad Juarez, but you get a fat ol' book stuffed with information on the technologies, strategy, and culture of the NGR and Gargoyle Empire, with notes on the rest of the city.If you like big high-powered toys and high adventure, get this supplement and loose your PCs on some gargoyles and Brodkil. If you are more subtle, there are a lot of cool espionage or political possibilities in this book. But whatever you are, if you are a big Rifts fan, this is one of the best books you could get.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Interesting and engaging would be the two words if you were asked to describe the film in just a second. I believe the film leaves no effort in putting things in the most genuine way possible. The film beautifuly depicts the 70's and its quite believable as you witness the settings, the costumes etc. Reasonable performence from almost everyone in the film, specially Christina Ricci as the curious young girl. She delivers an excellent performence, very genuinely shows a sexual maturity in a young girl. Her friendship with Sandy, her relationship with her father is believable and you can't take your eyes off her. The film will definately grab your attention and you will definately feel you are witnessing a family next door.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I really enjoyed this book (like all the others of Theroux that I have read) as it I could really imagine the places that he went to. Theroux's insight and observations are fascinating.The only criticism I have is that we do not know how long it took him to complete his journey. Or did he perhaps interrupt his travels?I also found it quite disturbing that there were a few editing mistakes: the Big Five does not include the giraffe but consists of the elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo and rhinoceros. A freeway in Afrikaans is not a ""vryweg"" but a ""hoofweg"".He also tends to repeat himself a bit. Perhaps some tighter editing in the next edition is called for.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"It's difficult to add to the previously written reviews of this book, since those reviewers already said it all. I can only concur with their opinions and thoughts, and add that the book brings back a flood of memories. Since my particular experience was mainly with the BUF, I immensely enjoyed reading this book. From the boredom of alert duty to the tedious flights from Anderson to SEA during Arc Light, all may not have been glamour or glory. However, excitement and drama certainly did occur during those war days. The camaraderie and friendships that developed were deep and lasting. It's a ""must read"" for any former SAC mamber, especially B52 personel.",,1

I held it for 2 wks until I consulted a NY DJ about it. Whatever he and LLV do as MAW is magic, but there is something less desired here.

TONE_POLARITY,"I can't believe the rave reviews this CD is getting! I bought it because of the great things people are saying about it. I am terribly disappointed. This CD is not any good. The songs are ""bubble gum"" era, on most tracks the orchestration and backup singers are too loud and you can't hear Clay, the songs are not memorable and most of the words to the songs are really stupid. More importantly, they failed to listen to Simon's critique of ""picking the right song for your voice."" None of these songs are right for Clay. I can't believe Clive Davis produced this CD. Maybe I was expecting too much from a first CD, but my opinion is that this CD stinks. If you want a good CD, buy Bette Midler's new CD or a Josh Groban CD. Immensely better and you won't be disappointed.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I buy my books based on reviews by Amazon. After having read 1/3 of the book, I decided to reread the reviews again and I wouldn't doubt that they are written by the author or her friends and almost all are dated around the same time period. One reviewer stated some drivel about being unable to sleep without the light on again or some such nonsense. This book is ""simple"". Emily did this or Emily did that. The couple were professing there love on their first date. No suspense. Nothing but boredom. I don't plan on reading the rest of this book and I'm angry that I even spent a dime on it. So beware if you are thinking on purchasing this book and look at the dates on the reviews. I should have guessed these reviews were false d/t the 11 five star reviews. Come on! Not one person gave it less? I tried to find something else she had written and was unable to. Probably because the publisher wasn't going to take a chance on losing more money.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This is probably my third favorite Bryan Ferry CD, following ""Boys and Girls"" and ""Bte Noire."" It maintains the atmospheric production of those two CD's (this time courtesy of Robin Trower) and also ponies up with some great writing from Ferry.The players all pitch in with great work. Old Roxy friends Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and Brian Eno contribute to most of the songs, along with notable musicians like Maceo Parker, Nile Rodgers and Pino Paladino. They all pile on rich, lush layers of sound, buoying Ferry's timeless tenor. While ""Mamouna"" is probably one of Ferry's lesser known albums, I probably return to this one more that, for instance, ""Taxi"" or ""Frantic."" If you prefer Ferry's work in the ""Avalon"" era, then ""Mamouna"" will probably be to your tastes.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this alarm hoping it would be an upgrade from the EXTREMELY poor-quality Kidde alarms that came with our house (they are supposedly 3 years old but most have already failed catastrophically - they are Kidde 0915 if you are in the same situation). However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier.

TONE_POLARITY,"I agree with another review that this would be an excellent book for couples in pre-marriage classes. Women tend to underestimate the prevalence and strength of lust issues in men. Men tend to be clueless about the destruction their lust can wreck on a relationship.

I am not going to say anything about the ending, because it will give the movie away for the people that haven't seen it. But this was one of the best movie's that I haven seen in a long time. It goes to show you that some people just don't care what others thing about you. That is what this movie told me. Simon was a kid that was different from everybody else and he always thought that God made him the way he was for a certain reason and he was right. There was a lot of things that he didn't understand about some of the things that other people did and got into trouble sometimes. But it all worked out for the better at the end of the movie.",,1

The beauty factor, the free medical care and cures, the free gadgets and gifts, this all opens up some interesting story lines about people's weaknesses.

The band avoids cliches of romantic, commercial rock, but the lyrics have never been particularly strong or innovative.MOVING TARGETS doesn't exactly capture the band's live electricity, but is a competent rendering of the Penetration at their most creative and consistent.

TONE_POLARITY,"Connie Mason books are often unpredictable. The hero is not a bad sort- really. He wants the dowry that would come with the woman but he is also somewhat of a decent type. When given the chance to cheat, he does not take it. The heroine is very annoying. All of the back and forth she does with I want you, I don't want you, I want you, I don't want you just killed this book for me. I could not get past it. I am all for strong heroines who stand up for their rights but she got rather ridiculous. I am affraid Ms. Mason overwrought her on that.

TONE_POLARITY,"The ""Brothers Bloom"" has a great cast and fine acting.It has lush, amazingly varied scenery--St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico, Montenegro, Japan, etc.It has decent direction.But it doesn't work. The problem is the writing. The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.Ultimately, the movie lacks energy. Lacks tension. Lacks conflict. Lacks suspense. Lacks coherence.It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.Pity.It is no accident that by far the most interesting character is Bang Bang--who has no lines.Without a coherent script, no movie can succeed.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs. One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys. I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided. On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them. In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls. By three hours there were no treats left in either of them. Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too. The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.

TONE_POLARITY,"Buying an artist's first effort, especially one from a band that is not well known, can be risky. However, I find Muse's Shobiz to be a fairly consistent album and the band itself musically talented. You will not find the typical CD formula here, where 2 or 3 tracks are radio-worthy and the rest of the album is fluff or ""filler"" material. If you find yourself enjoying the sample audio, you can expect the same quality on all tracks. I hesitated using the term ""radio-worthy"" to describe Showbiz because these tracks will never ride the American airwaves. The only downside to Showbiz is that it's one of those albums you tend to get bored with if you listen to it too often. However, I just dusted mine off and am currently enjoying it again.",,1

Cheesy to the extreme, 90's CGI, absurd script, pointless drivel. DEMONS was a ""there is nothing else out to rent this week"" rental.

TONE_POLARITY,"Because of my limited knowledge of modern day space exploration, I did not know what to expect when I saw this film. After viewing it, I knew it wasn't just ""another space documentary"". It was deeper than that. It was in my words, a ""space age gangster flik"". I say this because the whole concept of pushing the envelope and successfully launching a privately funded space station under the radar of NASA & the government was just too smooth! Plopping down huge amounts of cash , putting it all on the line for the sake of introducing space travel to the masses. All of this & doing so ""privately"" without government intervention... well that was the plan. What a concept!Michael Potter's vision was truly multidimensional. Throughout the movie there was a consistent layer of ""techie & science"" but underneath the veil lies the real concept..Space entrepreneurs, space geeks, conspiracy theorists, or just curious, all have a place enjoying this film & I recommend it for your viewing.",,1

Unfortunately, I tried this hair dryer 4 times, but just couldn't get myself to like it. I have naturally straight, medium thickness, color treated (dry) hair so I'm looking for shine/moisture and body in a hair dryer. This hair dryer gave me neither. In fact, I compared it to my old conair travel hair dryer (blew dry half my hair with the conair, half with the babyliss) and I found the babyliss side of my head to be much dryer with many more flyaways than the other side of my hair. The babyliss did nothing for my hair body either, and instead kind of gave it a weird square shape. All in all I would say that maybe this hairdryer works for people with curly or very thick hair, but if you do not have this hair type BE VERY WARY OF LISTENING TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I can't believe it took 7 years for this. All I Need is the best song on the CD but its all downhill after that. Not sure who this album is supposed to appeal to, and by the looks of its success and availability, I guess not to many. Most of you seem to like it so I am obviously the minority here. I am still a huge fan of songs he did with the Doobies (i.e. Nothing But a Heartache, Dedicate this Heart, Your Made that Way, Losin End, etc.) and I liked If That's What it Takes, but most songs on Blue Obssession are nothing more than Easy Listening music that's not so easy to listen to. The upbeat songs sound forced. On Build Upon It, which is a Takin' It to The Streets rip off, before the song even opens and sets a tone, its already in the chorus. If this was Michael's first album, I would never buy his second.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"You really get a full band feel throughout most of this album and they add horns to many of the tracks as well. The only problem with this album is that it is their longest and features the most amount of songs that are longer than their trademark of under 3 minutes, even 2 minutes. There are a number of songs on here that are longer than 4 and some that just feel longer. AT a certain point it just feels as if the album has stayed past its welcome. I'm not sure if it does. I like this album because it shows the influence of grunge on a few tracks while also staying true to the stylistic flipping from song to song that they are known for. You might not make it through the entire album in one sitting, but it's still high quality.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this peeler in November 2011. The peeling function works great. However the rubber suction cup that secures it to the counter will no longer produce enough suction to make the product stable enough to use. The item was not heavily used, perhaps once or twice per month. It was only used when my wife made apple pies since we never bother peeling potatoes.Now I am in the market for another peeler with a more durable mechanism for securing to a table top or counter. If you look at this item as disposable after 1 year, then go ahead and purchase. But if you want a kitchen utensil that will provide years of use, do not purchase this product.I give it two stars because the peeling function works quite well. But it is now useless since it can no longer be secured to the table.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I liked the fact the book was written by an ex employee of a major corporation in a manner that related the true feelings that many management employees experience, but do not have the courage to talk about, much less write about. It brings home the job pressures and the need to continually perform and improve. It also clearly outlines what lengths the corporate world will go to to maintain control.The author is to be saluted for having the backbone to fight back and to stand for principle. Most of all it is a story of his tenacity and need to persist and to get answers. Several of the chapters deal with the author's dark side and indiscretions which add flavor, but cause one to say ""why did he do that?""",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I first heard ZB on the local 'smooth jazz' station back in '96 or so. It naturally stood out strongly because it is not smooth jazz, or at least what I think of as smooth jazz. Peter White is smooth jazz, with boring drum machines, limited tone, and just plain fluff. ZB represents the long lineage of fine true jazz guitarists that came before him, from Charlie Christian through Wes Montgomery and Grant Green, then George Benson, and now with the likes of Chris Standring and Norman Brown. This is real music, with soul and punch, and great variety of moods on one disc. It's worth every penny. I also have Laidback and Groovin' (which I found in a Tucson used music store in '99, after searching for a copy for 6 months...)

I'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details. There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages, in my opinion.

I tried different blades, new blades, different speeds, faster and slower feed, I verified that the blade was 90 deg. to the foot, but nothing worked. After about 1' of cutting the blade would angle out to the right a pull the saw off course.I returned the saw and bought a porter cable unit. I thought this one may have been a fluke, a rare defective product from DeWalt, because I own other DeWalt equipment which works great. But just today, a co-worker told me of the exact same problem he was having with the same model. He went through the same steps I did trying to determine why the saw wouldn't work properly. But had no luck. He is returning the unit as well.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have now bought these bibs repeatedly for my own children, as well as gifts for several others. They are by far, the BEST BIBS EVER! They are soft & thin & comfortable for the kiddos to wear, yet waterproof & protect their cute little clothes. The velcro is secure but easy to use. I love the pockets, as they catch a lot of the mess & end up protecting little laps as well(& my kids have learned to eat ""seconds"" out of the pocket). They are so easy wash or rinse & they dry very quickly. I usually use one bib per day-rinse between meals/snacks & hang dry-then the bib is dry & ready for the next meal or snack.

Too many times the milk is sucked up in the tube, and even spills because it is not letting down into the bottle - very annoying.

TONE_POLARITY,"My family is originally from Eatonton, Ga, so I was interested to see what Mr. Moreland had to say. My dad knows a lot about the stalking case against Mr. Moreland and my mom knows some of the women portrayed in his book. We really wonder how someone can say the things he has said in print about these people and get away with it. He has defamed some very fine people and attempted to denigrate a whole town. As a black woman growing up in small town Georgia in the '40s, I experienced the typical incidents of racism, but I've experienced much worse in other places! Blacks and whites in Eatonton get along very well and have for many years. There are numerous black elected officials there at both the city and county levels. Mr. Moreland's ""true story"" is simply not true, either with respect to the ""fabricated"" stalking case or the race relations! Besides, he's a horrible writer...actually, the whole book reads like it was written by a boy! I'm sorry I bothered.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Christopher Hitchen's book ""No One Left To Lie To"" could have been great. I've always enjoyed his entertaining style and trenchant analysis in Vanity Fair. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. There may be insightful commentary buried in here, but it is under literally bucketfuls of invective, name-dropping, and self-aggrandizing. Hitchens clearly lacks emotional distance from his subject and he comes off petulent and mean-spirited. While this book is quite short, the reading of it was as arduous a process as picking up War and Peace in the original Russian. NOT recommended.",,0

The documentary side of it features facts (and a little bit of poetry) from a few narrators, including Neil Armstrong. I'm no expert on tornadoes, so I can't judge the accuracy of the facts. The footage of tornadoes dates back all the way to 1928.The most captivating thing about it, though, is that for long stretches of the program, the narrator is silent, with only the ambient music and occasionally sounds from the tornadoes creating the atmosphere to match these stunning images. Like listening to Tangerine Dream, this film is spellbinding enough to put me in a trance.",,1

I especially liked the "" if you are at someones home and there isn't any ash trays provided, don't ash in a potted plants or saucers.There is an illustration on how to tie a bow tie, but the book doesn't cover any other tie knots.

Uncensored 97 you could say was a ""turning point"" for WCW as Sting came from the rafters during the main event and attacked the nWo after months of silence and sitting in the rafters.

It is similar, especially in the first book, The Sword and the Stone, to the Orwell Animal Farm in that it is simple, if you choose to look at it that way, but can be enjoyed on several levels.

So if you're not using the mouse for just a little bit, it powers down and waits for movement.It's a very ergonomic mouse, with responsive buttons and nice LED indicators, but if it can't let you move around the screen when you need it to it's not much more than a (bad) paperweight.

TONE_POLARITY,"When you hear leftist MIT professor Noam Chomsky talking about ""the deadly effect of US-imposed sanctions on Iraq,"" you squirm a little, wondering. Then you read many credible sources citing the death of over one million innocent people (including some 5oo,ooo children) as a result of these sanctions. This makes you cringe a little more, but you still wonder about the reality of it all. Although this book does not furnish any photos of children with one mutant eye bulging out their head from exposure to depleted uranium radiation, it does nonetheless paint an accurate picture of the current situation. (Btw, I was exposed to footage of ""dumpster babies"" and mutant children in Japan, so you can take my word when I say that you wouldn't want to see such photos anyway.) Moreover, the book will provide you with the most up-to-date information about the sanctions available in print. If Iraq, biological warfare or sanctions are issues that interests you, this book is not to be passed up.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.,,0

I have now used it on my own creation which I cook on a stone and on a pizzeria-bought pie that needed re-slicing. Cut through them both like butter. The size does not get in the way and you really don't even have to press down too hard because of the solid weight of this ""pizza wheel"". I am very satisfied but I removed one star due to the fact that the wheel/blade cannot be removed. It would have been fairly easy for Oxo to make this product with a removable blade for thorough cleaning and for ease of sharpening. I'm disappointed about this.

TONE_POLARITY,"I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in ""IT"", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me.

TONE_POLARITY,"The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?",,0

At one point in BTFoN the characters travel to earth's moon. But in TCATS, we learned that the moon was destroyed millions of years ago!

TONE_POLARITY,"Marcus Buckingham is passionate about helping you identify your unique strengths and unleash their power. As you read and work your way through the program in this book, you will become convinced that growing through your strengths is the ticket to your future happiness, effectiveness and success. He refutes the approach of improvement by fixing mistakes as a dead end that cannot help you discover how you can be exceptional. The book constantly refers you to its associated Web site for materials that will help you work through the exercises. Buckingham wants you to act rather than just read a theoretical tract. Nothing presented in this book will help you without action and implementation. However, if you take up the challenge, you will become empowered as you take charge of your work through your strengths. We recommend this book because it contains just a few simple ideas that could change your life.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Frankly, for the $$ I was unimpressed. I had heard great things about this series and was sorely disappointed. Each of the presentations seem very ""low budget."" The filming content did not keep the attention of either my child or my nieces or nephews, ages 6 months to 4 yrs. Next time, I will tape animal/art programs from either Discovery Channel or Animal Planet and play my classical CD's in the back ground. Save your self the $$.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I expect that I am not alone in being highly amused by the inventiveness of some of the online reviewers for this book, whose acidic sense of humour and satire seems lost on the more sedate minds of others. Might I suggest that 'Sue D'eauymme, 'Steven Spielberg' et al seem to have the making of great comedy screenwriters? It would be interesting if any of their scripts ever came across Jennifer Lerch's desk!The book, incidentally, is a rather average concoction which borrows heavily from other volumes and seems to revel in stating the obvious. There seems little point in reading it unless you are completely in the dark about screenwriting.",,0

It is really clear with no static and you can hear every little noise, plus I like the 2 receivers.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Have been using this Capresso grinder for about two months now, and it is an exceptional product. The features are quite good. It does require a little experimentation at first because the dial for the amount of coffee you grind is in terms of grinding seconds, not cups, and there are a number of gradations of grinding from fine to coarse that you will have to get used to. The learning curve, however, is very fast, and you can quickly determine the optimum grind for your beans. It is very quiet, and very attractive on our black granite counter.Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder, Stainless Steel",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"A best-seller in its day, Quaker City is a violent and surreal look at the life of the citizens of Philadelphia in the 1840s. Anyone who likes Edgar Allen Poe or the Marquis de Sade will find this an interesting read; written off by critics as blatantly pulp, before such a term existed, they considered its mass appeal a sign of weakness, and by 1900, it had vanished from most lists of important American novels. I'm glad that critics are reconsidering its position, and I look forward to more of Lippard's novels coming back to print. Devil-bug, the mastermind of evil, is a great villain, and he looks ahead to Jarry's Pere Ubu, Faulkner's Popeye and many of the great surreal or superreal villains of the twentieth century.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"For me, Noah Gordon has created a ""time machine"" in The Physician. In its pages I am transported to northern europe's darkest hours. I can almost feel the misty mornings and smell the muddy roads along which a ""touched"" boy trods, searching for his place in a threatening world. We are offered a well developed and supported transformation from the young man's early survival years to his life-making, heart-wrenching commitment to the art of healing. Along the way, we witness many fascinating points relating the beliefs and practices of Judaism. The historical points are well-researched and well-placed.The pace of The Physician slowed just long enough for me to take a deep breath - now and then - and jump back in! The ending made sense and felt good to me. So much so that I located and purchased Mr. Gordon's other books! If they are near to The Physician's satisfying read, I'll be very happy indeed!",,1

I am almost finished and she is about halfway through. We started in August and I can now play most simple songs, Happy birthday, Twinkle twinkle, basic Christmas carols, anything simple I can find music for.It is fun and easy and I now practice almost every day. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach themselves a bit of the basics or for parents who want to see how interested their kids are before paying for lessons.It covers notes and chords and explains how to play and read both.It isn't really a ""girl"" book, except the first few pages are girly.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Another book is the much better book on the Pacific War and that better book isEagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan, which has more recent information and a more balanced view.

TONE_POLARITY,"Walk the Line sheds light on the life of the well-known singer Johnny Cash.It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.The only major setback is in relation to Ginnifer Goodwin who is not that great as Vivian Cash.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"James Peterson has put together a veritable encyclopedia about vegetables in this great book. It covers all the most common everyday vegetables, plus a large number of not so common vegetables.

One of my favorite recipes made from this book was Tomato Gratin With Bread, Cream And Bacon. As the host of my own culinary website Italian Food Forever, and someone who collects cookbooks, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in vegetables.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Want to know why many people fear and loathe technology? Read anything Kurzweil has written. This book draws the incredibly arrogant conclusion that just because computers will soon surpass human being in computing power, they will become superior thinkers and spiritual beings.What a load of crap. Tell me, who will write the software that exceeds human intelligence? The machines themselves? Or perhaps the geniuses of modern computing, who can't even write code to shut down a modern PC without crashing it 20 percent of the time.This book is a catalog for sci-fi horrors.

TONE_POLARITY,"I am a big fan of alot of genres including stupid comedies like biodome,Bill and ted, airplane, and son in law. But while I can take and even enjoy a mild amount of sick jokes, this crossed the line by about 50 miles. The saddest thing was that this was a hit. There were a few chuckles and one huge laugh,the wazzup scene, but otherwise it was just people making fun of small penises, penisis caught in thongs, and more penises.

TONE_POLARITY,"Tarzan and the Forbidden City has all the usual elements of the formula: cruel villians, some comedy, lovely heroines, and threatening wild beasts. The first half of the book was better than average pulp adventure. Here, the pace moved quickly; the story's main conflicts emerged in the midst of Burrough's evocative depictions of the threatening and unknown regions of the African jungle. However, towards the end, the tension bogs down into a series of relentless and wild action sequences where cliffhanger follows upon cliffhanger, stretching the bounds of plausibility, even for a Tarzan story.",,0

Other people wrote reviews saying not to get this if you want the microphone capabilities, but I'm here to tell you it isn't just the microphone that is bad quality - its the headphone jack too. The quality of sound coming out of the headphone jack is worse that subpar, it barely qualifies as audible noise. There is so much static, I can hardly recognize the original sound. The fact that I would rather use my malfunctioning laptop audio jack should speak volumes about the poor quality of this product. Also, the minimum volume is way too high for easy listening, even if it were audible.Even though it is cheap, don't get it. It is not worth wasting your time/money or the time/money of the poor Chinese guy who sells it for under $3 and ships it halfway around the world for free.",,0

I picked it up at a book store, planning only to read it until the books I ordered arrived, but I got into the story so much I've gotten addicted to the series, I've ordered two more. ""Vector Prime"" is wonderfully written and has action after action. It has fallowed up on the characters very well and has given us the chance to witness, possiblely the down fall of our beloved characters. The introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong gives our heros a worthy villan. Plus, the writer adds something to the story that will change the lives of our hero's forever.If you haven't read this book, read it, if you have read this book, read it again!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Bought this adapter to work with the Koolatron P-20 cooler (/warmer), but unfortunately after 30 minutes of cooling indoors it began to emit a burned resistor smell. And when I picked it up, it was very hot to the touch. Not good signs, from my experience.Comparing it to my AC-to-DC adapter from Igloo, it's much lighter and seems to be under-designed. You can't fool Mother Nature--increased weight usually means greater power handling capacity. In this case it just isn't there. Overheating isn't what I bought it for, either. In contrast, the Igloo adapter works endlessly with getting overly hot or giving off a smell. It weighs almost twice as much, too, which seems to be related.Save your time and money and get something more capable. You'll be glad you did. Amazon has been breathtakingly cooperative in this matter, by the way, at least so far. Free return shipping and emailed labels are the way it should be done.",,0

This a mixture of Jethro Tull kind of music and western classical with a little touch of Indian Classical music (In The Times Of India).

TONE_POLARITY,"I had to read this Book for my Operation Management class at UNCC.I think this book was wonderful, since I enjoyed every page of. I believe that Eli Tolerate demonstrates his genius both as a thinker and as a teacher with ""The Goal"". As in any other well-written novel, The Goal examines issues in dispute which create conflicts. The operational concepts that he presents are revolutionary in their practicality and common-sense approach. This book is presented with a storyteller's passion for detail, while still driving the key learning points of the theory. This makes sticking with it to the end much easier, which is important, as several key concepts are not revealed until the final pages. Every organization can benefit from the concepts presented in ""The Goal"". Eli Goldratt has written a novel in which he provides an analysis of those concepts as applied in a fictional company. He has a cast of characters, a plot, and a context. He relies heavily on dialogue to advance the narrative.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Well this is my fourth HP printer to dispose of. Basically they last a year until they start having feed problems. Warranty support is non-existent. Ink is exorbitantly priced. Software is bloatware that comes with all sorts of add-ins you will never use. The unit inexplicable goes into a system check at random times, or more appropriately it senses your urgency to get the printed document before deciding if it will make you wait an extra 3 minutes. I've bought my last HP printer and I'll lobby Costco to stop carrying them.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Computer books seem to break down into one of three major categories: theoretical concept overviews, exhaustive step-by-step learning guides, or pinpoint reference guides (e.g. O'Reily In-A-Nutshell). This book is a muddled mix of all three without achieving the benefits of any. It's too lightweight and disorganized to be a reference manual and too cursory to be a learning guide.I am over 100 pages into this and I am not quite sure if I have learned anything useful. It was clearly written without an objective in mind, which is evident chapter after chapter. It was comforting to see that many others share my opinion. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm an attachment parent so baby wearing is a daily thing for my family. I've tried every kind of wrap, sling or carrier, and the Moby wrap made me so uncomfortable I almost had to ask my husband to cut me out of it. First off, I'm tall and slender, and when I would wear my daughter in it, I looked pregnant again. It's so unflattering. Too bulky. Also, even in the dead of winter, it made me so hot I couldn't wear it. I'm sure I was having hot flashes because of breast feeding hormones, but isn't it inferred/implied that the woman wearing the Moby wrap might be breast feeding?! If you're looking for an easy way to wear your baby, IMO go for a ring sling. On a daily basis I use the Sakura Bloom linen slings. It takes a little practice, just like any baby carrier does, but once you get it you just slip your baby in and go. And you don't have to take it completely apart to take it off. And it won't make you look like you're twice your size.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Transmetropolitan is a great series, it's filled with quite a bit of punky, quirky, and deadly sci-fi elements, it's got great coloration and it seems quite well written.

I suppose if you just distance reality, and don't take it seriously, it's quite the entertaining read.",,1

The mounting stem locks into the base with a quick-release key.

""Highly inspirational"", a rollicking young hipster blurted out. The Statue was all these things, and then some. But could they make an album? Many spectacular live bands have trouble going from the live world to the studio world. Well simply put, they got it taken care of. This album ranks high among my favorites. The Statue is one of those bands that has so many influences it would be impossible to name a few bands or styles as their influence. All I can say is that I've played this CD for fans of jazz, blues, hard rock, pop, and bluegrass, and all of those people have bought ""Drinking From the Water Clock"", or gone to a Statue show.

I've tried many different ways to improve my eating habits over the years, but none of them ever really seemed to make complete sense to me. I just knew there had to be a better/smarter path. It's true, this way of cooking will require more planning on your part, but it was still a lot of fun. Actually, it was more fun cooking this way than other methods I'm used to. I imagine as I become more familiar with this way of cooking it will become much easier. While I've only made a few of the recipes so far, I have to say they were the best tasting meals I have ever prepared.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a well written book. However, there is a tendency amongst students who are bogged down on reading cases to pass over this sort of material too quickly, thus getting only a shallow apprehension of the subject. The author notes how words often do double and triple duty such that ""You may want to join the bar but may be barred if you fail the bar and wind up tending bar or selling candy bars."" Page 13. Thus, the author points out a critical feature of legal reasoning: ""Legal rules characteristically require interpretation, which is an important part of legal reasoning."" id. I recommend this book for honing those much needed skills in the practice of law and recommend that it be read slowly, not quickly. I also think a reader should consult Martin P. Golding's book ""Legal Reasoning,"" Ruggero Aldisert's book ""Logic for Lawyers,"" and Stephen Toulmin's book ""The Uses of Argument."" (Toulmin shows the uniqueness of legal reasoning in contrast with nonlegal reasoning).",,1
TONE_POLARITY,No doubt the book is beautiful. The photographs and text are just enough for the eye-candy type book it was meant to be. My problem with it is that the title should have made it more clear that these rings are mostly 'artwear' and not jewelery like most of us expect. The book is intended for the experimental artists not for serious jewellers. There are *some* stunning examples of real jewelry and extremely creative and innovative styles but very few. The '500 brooches'book is the same. The cover and back plate are a little deceiving. Worth getting out of the library but not buying.,,0

After the corruption there's no reliable way to recover from it because firmware upgrade may not work anymore.

I needed a radio for my porch and was convinced by all these reviews that it would do as well or better than Bose for a much lower price. I was tired of moving my Bose back & forth from the kitchen. So I got it today, plugged it in, set the channels and found that it did not pick up many of the FM channels my old Bose brought in clearly. Then I compared the two side by side for sound quality.

TONE_POLARITY,"I know I shouldn't argue over an inexpensive title like this, but considering that this offers only 5 of the band's videos (Wildest Dreams, Other Side of Life, Running of Love, I Know You're Out There, and No More Lies), it dashes this fan's hopes that we will ever see a true, proper Video Collection by one of the greatest bands of all time. Most hardcore fans know that there are rare music videos for the songs Blue World and Sitting at the Wheel, and an even rarer, mostly unseen 1991 video for Say It With Love which is really sweet and SHOULD be included on this disc. All 5 of these videos are readily available on either the LEGEND OF A BAND DVD or the official Fan Club VHS that's been out for years. Someone missed the boat.

TONE_POLARITY,"I probably hadn't read a Piers Anthony book for over 40 years before a co-worker loaned me this one, but have always thought of him as a big-name sci-fi writer. That's why I was so stunned by the amazingly stilted dialogue. Real people don't talk that way. I don't know which surprises me more, that the writing is so bad, or that a fair number of readers describe it as well-written. Compared to what?! The numerous stories come across as intrusive, the author continually interrupting the flow of the narrative so we can see what a story teller Oenone/Jade/Nympth, etc. is, but it finally just becomes boring. Nor was I conned by his author's note at the end, in which we are to understand that what looks like a paedophile friendly worldview is just his attempt to bring to light the problems of child and wife abuse.

This author is in wonderland if he expects any average person (and it doesn't even matter what click or scene you were in while in high school) to believe or relate to this story.

TONE_POLARITY,"Peel songs can be something or not. The UNDERTONES were one of those bands who pretty much recreated their songs in the Peel studios live like they sounded on their records. I've heard several live UNDERTONES shows and they really got into it. Actually, I sent like 12 friends and relatives to see their San Diego show in like 1980 and I was workin' that evening. BUMMER.So, yeah, these Peel songs are nice but not crucial. Yer not gonna hear great variations on the studio versions here. A big UNDERTONES fan should definitely get them cuz, well, cuz it's more UNDERTONES, in theory. Otherwise, I'd stick with their studio albums.I always wanna hear Peel sets by the bands I really like to see if there's variations on some of their great songs. You don't really find that here. SLITS did a cool Peel set. Heck, there's gobs of bands who played it over the decades. I'm just glad they've released a bunch of 'em. chrisbct@hotmail.com",,1

I believe that Carman's message is so dangerous that it is not protected by the First Amendment.

But, I did find out how great Amazon's return policy is and I returned the unit postage free the day after I got it. I'm still looking for a charger/transmitter. I bought a Belkin today but, the static is loud in the background and it does not charge the Ipod...only runs the Belkin transmitter.

Never get tired of listening to Anya, Twist in The Tale, Ramshackle Man and Nasty Piece of Work. Nothing wrong with the other tracks *(except One Man's Meat) either.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is written with such a passionate aim: to help God's children experience the fulness that His Holy Spirit has to offer. How to Be Filled With the Holy Spirit is written in a very balanced Charismatic viewpoint. It reveals how to receive the Holy Spirit in a way that changes one's life and one's life for Christ. This is one of the best books written on the subject. Many authors, evangelists, and pastors just say ""God bless you"" and finish there. But Aiden W. Tozer goes beyond that. He tells you HOW you can receive the blessing. That's what makes Mr. Tozer an excellent author. Being filled with the Holy Spirit is a continuous process and this book explains that wonderfully. The Holy Spirit is here on earth for all of us. He's here to give us power and comfort. All we have to do is receive Him. In return, we'll be filled! Buy this book! It will definitely get your spirit excited and on fire for Jesus!",,1

How do people know this? Are there written records? If so, why aren't they quoted? Or why, at least, are they not cited so I can go look them up?

Some of it was; but, all in all, the politically correctness of the characters was exaggerated to the extreme. I am sure that somewhat similar people exist here and there, but to put them all together makes for pure fantasy.Hynes character description is detailed and very humorous. Without this I would not give even a two star rating. Also his ""one liners"" bring on a chuckle.The ending borders on the ridiculous. Perhaps it had a deeper meaning than I was able to fathom, but male and female bodies interchanging, spirits (or someone) jumping off a parapet. academics having a free for all shootout on a lonely campus, towers collapsing in a conflagration, etc., etc. How much liberty can an author take with fiction.

TONE_POLARITY,"This middle volume of the William Kite series is actually the first of the trilogy that I have read, but I am compelled to read the rest. This narrative is quite different than your run-of-the-mill sea fiction in that it treats a civilian's perspective of the war at sea and charts the development of the protagonist from isolated merchant skipper to a driven privateersman. It is particularly noteworthy in two respects--Kite is very much a real person and does not suffer from an incredible/implausible list of infallibly heroic traits--Kite sees the American ""patriots"" in a strikingly de-mystifying way.The book's style is influenced by Victorian writers in general.

It can be put together right and make something beautiful that you can be proud of, or it can be put together to make the ugliest worst looking thing ever seen.

The storyline is a good, well-thought out one with interesting turns to it. King creates a wonderful cast of real and likable characters caught in a mess of insomnia, violence, and abortion. This is a good book, it just took me a long time to read. Sometimes you have to patient with it, in the end something DOES happen. What I liked best about the ending was that it did not just end abruptly. There was an ending, and then the epilouge was a whole other ending altogether and it really made the book worth it. Very nice.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This recording of the fabulous grand concertos by Corelli is one of the best recordings that I own. These concertos should not be taken for granted; they set a precedent for the Concerti grossi by Handel, Geminiani, and many others.I Musici employs their impeccable technique, tone, articulation, and dynamics in this recordings. Philips held up their part of the deal; the sound quality on the recording is unbelievable. No other recording that I own is as crisp and clean as this recording is.

TONE_POLARITY,"I had a bad christmas and was sick of the drama. I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie ,because burn after reading was so terrible( in my opinion). And no country for old men was well written, but the ending left me angry. This film plays like a spaghetti/western/comedy believe it or not. Jeff Bridges doesn't even try to be John Wayne, instead he plays the part like a skilled comedian ,but treads softly enough with the jokes so as not to become cartoonish. All throughout the movie, they play differant versions of leaning on the everlasting arms.Which is a interesting foil to the violent story unfolding on screen. The only complaint I have is Matt Damon, who I usually like is very annoying, and I kept wishing his character would die already.I smell an oscar nomination or two for Bridges or the very BRILLIANT young Ms. Steinfeld,(Mattie Ross) I think is she plays her cards right,she could end up in the ranks of Meryl Streep.",,1

My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards.

Unfortunately it is a real let-down when compared to MacDonald's great suspense novels of the same period, like ""The Brass Cupcake"" and ""Judge Me Not"". With those two novels MacDonald burst forth on the paperback original market in 1950, after his apprenticeship in the pulp magazines, as a fully developed talent, fully as great a writer from the get-go as he ever would be. Unfortunately, ""Wine of the Dreamers"", while it succeeds for its ideas, is a dud with respect to execution. It is telegraphed, some of the key scenes happen off stage, it reads like an outline for a novel that never actually got written.

I loved it so much, I had to get Orgazmo and Cannibal! The Musical too! They are all great movies, and I recommend that you try to see the other two if you liked BASEketball!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"If you are seeking an hour and a half of great entertainment, watch this movie. It's an intelligent, energetic, upbeat caper movie, with lots of twists. I had never heard about it, but came across it by browsing on Amazon, and the online reviews convinced me to try it. The characters are appealing, the action is steady, and you never know what's coming next. Even the music has a beat.Hurrah for little-known Canadian movies!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Oh, how I am loving the Harry Potter series (over and over again...) But great steaming dragon bogies: this 'sourcebook' is too much! Inspiration-spotting really isn't a spectator sport, I guess, but the whole 'Harry was once in a boat, so the author OBVIOUSLY intended us to be reminded of Jason and the Argonauts' approach is just shoddy thinking, surely? There ARE genuine mythical and spiritual roots to the Potter stories - but you won't find them here. The fact that the disclaimer - 'not approved by J K Rowling' - was hidden in gold lettering on gold background on the cover design suggests to me (alas, spotted too late!) that the book is trying to pass itself off as something it isn't. A blind guide. For goodness' sake, hold out for something Rowling DOES approve - and in the meantime, let's trust our own imaginations!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This book is great for someone who is interested in casting plastics and wants to get some basic experience without buying thousands of dollars worth of machinery. It is written well with lots of hints on how to keep the cost down as well as things he tried that didn't work out so that you don't make the same mistakes.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,I ordered two cases of these for my son. Both cases were opened immediately and both had many packages with mold and the ones that didn't were sour. Amazon quickly shipped me out two more cases with free one day shipping....both arrived with mold also. I just called and they were very apologetic and said that they would refund my payment. They must just have a bad batch. I will try to find these in a store.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Independence Day was my first soundtrack by David Arnold and it didn't take more than a minute to become a David Arnold fan. From the beginning, the music is brooding and eerie, foreshadowing the appearance of the massive alien ships. Once the aliens fire the first shot, all hell brakes loose as the action becomes rapid and intense between the good and bad. After very beautiful patriotic music, the battle continues for the final time, ending with victorious and extremely patriotic music. Listening to it makes you proud to be an American and human. I recommend this highly to first-time David Arnold fans.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This book is exactly what I was hoping for. It has great suggestions for for the modern bride who might be paying for most of the wedding along with her groom to be.

It is not the only book one would need, but it is perfect in addition to another guide or organizer.",,1

I'm sure I'll get more use out of the other stuff as my baby gets older though. I also bought an ""especially for baby"" kit that was very similar to this one just to keep in her diaper bag because it was cheaper, but definitely spend the extra to get this one. The nail clippers in the other one are useless.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"As a trained dancer, pianist, and teacher I have thoroughly appreciated Professor Fink's complete physical approach to piano technique. I have found it congruent with physical movement principles and especially applaud his emphasis on movement originating from the torso and the use of large muscle groups in sound production. As a teacher I have found it an exceedingly helpful guide for developing within students a thoughtful awareness of how their body ""dances"" at the piano in the creation of a musically beautiful and expressive performance. This book and video promote a healthy, whole body approach that is essential to long-term physical fitness at the piano. It is thoroughly worth the time and effort to study and master the principles laid out in Mastering Piano Technique.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I was thinking about getting a kindle until Amazon decided to delete purchased books from Kindle devices that users had purchased without warning. That the book was 1984 is beyond ironic. Now Amazon says that they cross their heart and hope to die and stick a needle in their eye won't ever do this again. I also promise that I will never ever buy a kindle from Amazon. Who knew that whispernet was just another way to monitor users and subject you to the arbitrary whim on whether you really own what you buy. I want to spend $300 on that. Oh wait, can they take the device back too?",,0

Apparently most of the events cited in the book never happened or were vastly over stated. This book was a BIG disappointment.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,Hot Body DVD's are decent - like a less well-produced Playboy video. The good news is that they provide plenty of nudity and more often than not they have some very hot models. The perfect case in point is Christy Carrera. Her tan-lined body is exquisite and there is more than enough time spent showcasing her. This is soft core porn at best. Nothing explicit. But Christy makes it all worthwhile.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. She requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. These seem to meet all those criteria. I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. I advised my daughter NOT to test them for water resistance!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"They may have been a one-hit-wonder, but what a hit! 96 Tears is still a unique rock song, full of hypnotic atmosphere and clever musicianship more than 40 years after its release. The other material on the album is interesting and for the most part, equally well-played and quite enjoyable though less remarkable and less commercial than the band's one big hit. Some songs are ballads, a few are quite bluesy, and others bristle with the unique sound that made 96 Tears a song worth listening to for more than 40 years. With 27 tracks on the CD it's a good sampling of what this band had to offer. I waited for years for this music to become available on CD and purchased this disc without hesitation once I discovered it. Don't sit ""down there, lookin up"", buy it now!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,With motor homes (and trucks) that have dual wheels it is critical that tire pressures be kept equal and at the proper psi. The Milton S976 is the most accurate gauge I have ever used. Its dual head is small enough to fit into the ports in the stainless wheel covers and makes it easy to reach the stem of the inside tire. You might pay a lot more for a gauge but you can't get anything better. The only down side is the size and weight. You won't be carrying it around in your shirt pocket.,,1

He also should stick to singing than playing the guitar.he needs also more input from the other bandmembers also.I think the lyrics need much more improvement also.I hope he starts to play something more like rock.This album is very mello for him.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This book has a lot of promise and a seemingly good message, but it does not succeed. The author is too long-winded and seems obsessed with the sexual aspect of the post-World War II American woman's problem. In my opinion she does not focus enough on the educational aspect. The book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. You could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. I found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. Basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so. However, for someone looking for a timeline of women's history in the early to mid 1900s, chapter 4 is very good.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This book was like trying follow a storyline of a movie that you told somebody to cut out all the connecting pieces. You are left with a bunch of siloquies that have no correlation to the surroundings. Better yet, it was like watching a movie review on TV. You are given the highlight speeches, but never the circumstances in which they are given. Joan did not live in a vaccuum. What she did and what eventually befell her depended on the reaction of those around her. This book is like an archeological dig. You get a lot of disjointed information and a time line, but you are left with a lot of questions about what happened in between these points. If you are interested in what happened to Joan and why it happened, do not waste your money on this low grade cliff notes project.",,0

Although I could still cue up my original vinyl LP to enjoy Verlaine's superlative songwriting and his majestic guitar work on this album, I took the time to digitize the record and burn my own CD. This is an album that I wanted to be able to enjoy at home or on the road. ""Lindi-Lu"" and ""Five Miles Of You"" are two of the best songs that Verlaine has ever recorded, but there's not a bad song on the whole collection! And his vocals have never been stronger. If you like Verlaine, if you like Television--hell, if you like the electric guitar--you should own this album!",,1

Hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. It's a stirring contrast. Hoffman has a real knack for romance, too. The way she describes the various loves of the Owens girls is raw, dramatic, yet not completely unrealistic.Awesome book. I read it in two sittings.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this CD some time ago as I am a fan of Taro Hakase, who is absolutely fabulous, and I ended up throwing it away. This is NOT Taro Hakase, but an artist named TARO.

TONE_POLARITY,"""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"While better than Insurrection, overall this movie stinks. I would actually give it two and a half stars. This one feels very forced, and while I appreciate the inclusion of the Romulans in a movie, it simply isn't ever convincing that Shinzon would want to destroy Earth. Even with the backstory they do provide, I couldn't believe he wants it that badly. The sudden addition of a new sub-class of Remans is lame. One could write off the coincidence of a race of aliens, just happening to share their name with the mythical founder of Rome. But when all of a sudden we learn of an off-breed of the same race that shares it's name with Romulus' brother Remus it becomes laughable. And perhaps it's a bit cruel, but Brent Spiner has gained weight since the series ended, and it's just odd to see the android Data with a second chin. Sorry, no good.",,0

Boy was I wrong.What I don't understand is what possessed the author into thinking he had a novel in him? Someone deluded him horribly. The book is at times unreadable for any number of reasons. It is unbelievable nonsense, terribly written and edited, and historically inaccurate to the point of being laugh out loud stupid.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book was an excellent read. It is not a book that is easily read, or that can be read in a hurry, but rather engages the reader to think and learn each character. I really liked how different characters were introduced throughout the book, even though it was a hostage situation and all characters were present, but not acknowledged until the twist of their character came forward. This is one of the few books I will read again. I had not thought about this until reading another review where it suggested that the ending was eluded to throughout the book.It was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time.",,1

I purchased it on Kindle, realized I needed a paper copy for my research, and bought the $9.99 ""high quality paperback"" version.However, this is literally the ugliest book in my house. It looks like it was constructed at Kinko's. I don't know quite what I was thinking here - perhaps that it was a placeholder icon instead of an actual version of the book. The cover actually does say ""HIGH QUALITY PAPERBACK"" and ""AFFORDABLE AND HIGH QUALITY PAPERBACK BOOK EDITION"", the spine is blank grey, the pages are not very firmly set, and the font is a faded Courier.

Even with the two level screw system it is difficult to keep a larger tree - say, anything 6 feet and up, from tilting in the stand. I noticed over the past couple of days the tree leaning ever so slightly, and this evening, CRASH there it went. The tree didn't come out of the stand, the whole stand tipped over with it.

TONE_POLARITY,"After all the hype, I purchased this game for my new PSP. I must say, this is the worst game I have ever purchased...ever! There is no story...in fact, there's nothing resembling any kind of direction or clue as to what you have to do, save for a small, vague blurb at each mission. Furthermore, when playing a mission, you spend 80% of the time just figuring out what you're supposed to accomplish! You die WAY too easily, which makes this game frustrating from the start. If you complete all the missions, you get nothing...absolutely nothing! Finally, the play control is painfully awful. This is a game that should never have come to the PSP, since it's completely vital to use either two analog sticks or a keyboard and mouse.Don't waste your time and money on this, whether it's just the game or the PSP bundle.

The performances are all top-notch, including career-best work from Julianna Moore, Tom Cruise and the late, great Jason Robards.

I get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure.

TONE_POLARITY,"Maybe I just didn't ""get it."" More likely my expectations were different than what the author intended. I was expecting ""hundreds of ideas to spark my creativity"" but got the same number of examples from Harpers, New Yorker, WSJ, Time and just about every other publication known to man, or so it seems. Yes I read some good, actually great, writing examples, but it never came together nor did I get the points being made. Perhaps I'll let it sit on the shelf a while and try again another day. For now, my recommendation is to pick up ""How to Write Articles for Newspapers and Magazines"" - more information in half the number of pages.",,0

You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik. It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. I most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great.",,1

Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses.",,0

At some point, you may think that the characters are going through a phase because they are in high school.

The rape scenes are quite disturbing if you analyze it from a humanistic and moral standpoint but if you can't then, eh, it's just a movie. There is NO explanation as to why this girl is dead and still alive. It's not that she's even a zombie needing Brains for dinner.

It really gave me insights into both life and death. I grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them. They made me look at my own life in a new way.The final three episodes are the best three episodes of any TV show, ever. I seriously spent almost the entire last three episodes crying.

There's not enough to cover both side rails, but he seems to only like to chew one side anyways. He hasn't chewed any more chunks of wood since putting this on and he seems content to chew on this instead. The only negative about this product is that the adhesive is not holding one of the ends down. I let it set for over 8 hours, so that's not the problem. It's only in one section, though. Fortunately, it isn't making it so my son's pulling it all the way off, so I'm overall pleased with this purchase.",,1

Just in case it was something wrong with our player or TV we tried it on three different DVD Players and TV's with no better results.Another strike against this particular set - no closed captioning. One would think when marketing classic films that would be a rather essential addition.

Of the Prey series, this is a standout for its plot about ugly sexual behavior in the sticks and for its detailed evocation of Minnesota in the dead (no pun intended) of winter. Mystery aficionados already know this book, and they'll tell you that another great thing about it is that Sandford plays fair with the plot. Things get strange, but there's a logical thread throughout. Superior reading for long-distance air travel.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I can sum up this movie in 5 words, what was the director thinking? What really made this movie unbearable and just absolutly ridiculous was the the script! The mysterious crystal skull plot from the begining I felt was stupid, from the moment I saw it in the theater. And the way it lead to Aliens was just plain si-fi foolishness. I don't want to make too big a deal over it, but that's not the traditional Indiana Jones theme. I'm sure if you all remember they were no other wordly creatures in any of the movies. This was one was a real mockery of Indiana Jones. I have no desire to buy it, really, and I don't think the traditional Indiana fans would either.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"One of the most boring and stupid books I`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better ""equipped"" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the ""fact"" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up.  Yes, and I spell terrible...",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I read some reviews of this group and they sounded interesting, so I tried them out. I wish I hadn't.As the title of this review states, it is like listening to the jr. high glee club, with a little backing from some second-string band members with horns. The music and lyrics are sophomoric and amateurishly produced, all the way around. The musicianship is poor - notes are missed, horns are mostly just blown, not played, and the sound is murky.Nearly all of the songs are bland ""uppers"" - it's a new day, the sun is shining, come on everybody let's sing! I'm all for music that makes you happy, but nice sentiment is not enough - the quality of the musicians, singers and producers has to be there, too.Finally, be warned: the last song is over half an hour(!) of monotonal chanting - a couple of guys basically intoning ""om"" at a few different levels.

The tedious narrative in the first person by the same characters one after the other and so on and so forth, while a novelty at fist soon becomes a tiresome reading exercise.

I can't say about her other books since this is the only one of hers I've ever read. I'm sorry, but I was so irritated by the writer's inaccurate reactions to the human behaviours.

Its really good that the price has dropped by about half however, I mean seriously.... This sure isn't Hamlet. The show is cheesy and cheap, but not in a bad way at all. I found it quite entertaining still. And it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful Lee Meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.The show is more serious then, and far less classic then, Lost in Space or Batman.

Writing a dumbed down version of ""Russia House,"" ""Parent Trap,"" and Anastasia, the author actually has a great plot and story idea, but she didn't research, didn't build up enough detail and didn't enrich this with real characters. The plywood cutout characters failed to elicit any emotional attachment from me and the whodunnit aspect of the story was apparent from the beginning. I wanted to get lost in the prose and the story, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Such a good story idea.

The introduction starts with Electric Eye just like they did on Rising In The East, on this dvd though the song sounds more like the studio version. Some of my favorites are on this one too such as Devil's Child, Screaming For Vengence, The Green Manalishi (with the two pronged crown), and Sinner was amazing.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a great addition to any collection of jazz and popular vocals. I got to see Maxine Sullivan during the second phase of her career, when she came back after working and raising her children to thrill those of us who weren't around for Phase 1. The lady loved good music and presented it well. ""Loch Lomond"" and the other classics from her early career were not among my favorites. But even in the 1930s and '40s, Maxine made memorable recordings of ballads like ""Easy to Love,"" ""Spring Is Here,"" ""Ill Wind,"" ""When Your Lover Has Gone,"" ""Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye"" and others. Her later recordings for the Concord, Audiophile, Atlantic, Baldwin Street, Kenneth and DRG labels were better than some of these early efforts, but this four-CD set shows you how it all began.

Hackman's bad guy acting in this film would be more suitable in a James Bond film, petting a white can, while talking about taking over the world. In any case the lead guy is boring, and come on now hidden cameras set upo everywhere to select a jurer? And 20 people at evil Hackman's service night and day.

TONE_POLARITY,"Bought this cd for my wife. Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion. There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men. And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus. Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd....",,0

It's this constant reinvention that has kept Depeche Mode around for nearly 20 years.As for the songs, my current favorites are ""Condemnation"", ""Mercy in You"", ""One Caress"", and ""Walking in my Shoes"". This, to me, is the third major turning point in the band (the first being after ""Speak and Spell"" and the second being around ""Some Great Reward"" and ""Black Celebration""). While this album is good, their subsequent release, ""Ultra"", is superior in almost every way and a strong contender with ""Violator"" for DM's top album.I like all of DM's music and it's this varying style that makes them one of the most interesting bands of the era.",,1

It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it.

And her writing is just plain bad. (""I thanked Susan B. Anthony for getting the women's lib ball rolling."") Her attempts at self-depracation ring false. Get over yourself, Kyle!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"We bought this game for Christmas. I wanted the wooden balls and a sturdy cage. The first unit that was shipped to us had a defective cage. I called the maker of the game instead of returning to amazon, because I wanted them to know about the quality error for such a high priced set. They shipped out a new cage very quickly at no charge. Our balls were well marked (two of the markings my 8 yr old had to look at twice, but were still readable). We would have liked a few mor cards in the set. I would say they are the weakest part of the set. The sliders do not easily move and there is no way to order additional cards and be sure there will not be a duplicate.Overall, we are happy with the set.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"When I sat down to play this game I got a strange feeling... some people call it ""deja vu."" I HAD PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE! It suddenly hit me that this game was pretty much BANJO KAZOOIE! Hello?! Am I the only game critic in the world to notice this? Sure, it's got some differences. The whole ""play the game 5 times so that you can beat it with ALL the kongs"" is different, but come on! Who wants to play the game that much anyway? This game became pretty frustrating at times and I grew to hate it. If you liked Banjo Kazooie, you may end up liking Donkey Kong 64... and well, if you are a Donkey Kong fan, definately check this game out... but if you aren't, you really should stay away from this game!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"when I first saw the price of this pack I was a lil disgruntled but I bit the Bullet and bought it anyways. Best backpack so far, Plenty of room for all of my stuff whether it be for school, hiking or just biking around the city. Not only does it have compartments for everything but it has some hidden extras that some of those who bought this bag may not be aware of. the waist straps can tuck in to the lil side pockets kind of like a hole that was not stitched there all the way. The other hidden gem is the chest strap has a lil whistle that can be used if your lost in the woods and people are trying to find you. It's plenty loud as well. just some additional added features that the product description does not tell you. It is also a very durable material that takes allot to tear. Overall I'l glad I spent the extra money for this bag.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It is full of grammatical, syntactical and spelling errors (for example, ""a lot"" is spelled as ""allot"" throughout the book). As far as the subject matter goes, it does an injustice to the word ""investing."" It would have been better to label it speculating or gambling. Even the late Al Frank, who based his stock buying on fundamental value, insisted on referring to the stock market as speculating. In any case, this book suffers from a classic case of confusing brains with a bull market. From 1995-2000, anyone could have ""succeeded"" in the stock market regardless of what market capitalization one decided to ""play."" Neither this book, nor most others on the subject, are particularly useful in knowing how best to ""invest"" in penny stocks over the long run.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I agree with the kids review below. This album along with all of their others is garbage. They just keep putting out the same album over and over.Do you really think in 10, 20, even 30 years, people are going to be playing Nickelback CDs and saying, ""Wow they were a great band""? Who goes around blasting Creed, Poison, Cinderella, Ratt, or C&C; Music Factory? This band will be forgotten just like these others.It's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing. They have found a formula that somehow sells records and so they've stuck with it. Watch their live performances with Chad's gay permed haircut. Someone should take their instruments away so they won't poison rock music anymore.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The Contest is both cheesey and engrossing. It reads like a Michael Crichton novel and smacks of a blockbuster movie with way too many CGI characters in our future. Despite that, however, The Contest is a highly enjoyable read, though the premise of hardly believable. But if you're looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day - or something to take with you to the beach this summer - The Contest is definitely a book worth checking out. Suspend your reality for a day, and give it a try. However, I'll take a moment to mention this is the only Matthew Reilly novel I would recommend. I attempted to read his other novels after reading this one and found them all to be stale and boring.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The two stars in my rating are not so much a comment on quality (although it has all the glitter of a 1940's graduate math tome), but as a warning that it is likely to be of value to an extremely limited audience. I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it.",,0

""Having no meaning or direction or purpose."" Exactly what this story represents. There is no depth to Holly Golightly's character. She talks in trivial roundabouts, is selfish and did nothing but try my patience. The narrator is flat, a wimp, and has no backbone. The story consists of mostly dialog, giving the reader no sense of being there.

The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action.",,0

There are plenty of jokes and gags follow that supposed to be hilarious and aren't. Granted, some movies are stupid but funny.

'Tommy Boy' is by far his crowning achievement on film and probably the only film starring Farley worth owning. This film shows Chris bloated and worn out from years of excess and is kind of hard to watch. It's a sad way to cap off a career that gave so many people joy. This is purely for the Farley diehard fans only. I just couldn't bring myself to give this 1 star!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I've purchased this book elsewhere. But this is not the point. I will compare it to Giles. Much better, both construction of the studying material and exam question-answer part. Unlike Giles, NPTE has thorough explained question and answer choices, and an option of pausing the test. NPTE has three exams. Giles though has four exams and visually it is constructed very closely to a real one, little if any question explanation. Bottom part you'll benefit from both. But if you're short of green go with NPTE. Don't know the difference between NPTE 2008 and 2009 editions though.

That was my own mistake of course. However, once realizing that, the kit seemed fairy empty, with charts, coupons, and scrolls that you can only use once. The cards are reusable, but that's the main item with content. Other objects seem to serve more as a distraction than helping you write.I do think the presentation of the kit and design is rather nice.

TONE_POLARITY,"""This Desert Life"", the newest album from The Counting Crows, seems to bring together everything that fans love about the band, Adam's dense, and incredibly meaningful lyrics, a multitude of instruments, and some wonderful harmony all have a chance to showcase themselves. Old themes, like 'Anna' and 'Maria' surface again, and are joined by 'Amy'. My overarching impression of this album as compared to the others is much happier. 'August and Everything After' seemed to swirl around losing yourself by making yourself a household name. 'Recovering the Satellites' was very dark. 'This Desert Life' is more upbeat, and had (to my ears at least) hints of CSNY (see 'Four Days')and the Black Crows (see 'Kid Things', the bonus track). I am hoping that the band will keep experimenting with musical styles (they cover a LOT of ground here), and instrumentation in the future. All in all, a wonderful album for CC fans out there.",,1

I do wish I had purchased the multi-chimes rather than the single one, though. It sounds nice but now I realize I would have liked a few sounds instead of just the one.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,A great book for a recent but historic perspective on the Vietnamese Central Highlands and her people.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I laughed out loud, I cryed out loud. I cannot get other the fact that this is the author's first novel. It is beautifully written, a love story for all times.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I aquired this book when a friend whom I had helped several times professionally as a hypnotherapist asked me to help her prepare for natural child birth.The book proved invaluable not only in the way it assisted in the deprogramming of the negative expectations and fear of chilbirth pervading our culture, but also as a basis of ideas from which to negotiate and plan a bespoke approach to preparing her and her birth team for the big event.It's not complete in itself and really does need to be used by someone competent in hypnosis, (we used other techniques form other disciplines as well) but it's a superb resource and I envision recommending it to many more people.And by the way, my friend felt no need to use pain relief, reported no pain, only ""sensations"", and she wasn't in any way attempting to mask the pain and the midwfe recorded second stage as lasting approximately 2 minutes!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchaed this amp because I purchased a different Power Acoustik amp for my other car and loved it. Like the other one I own, this one also has loads and loads of power I don't even have it maxed and the output is amazing. If you aren't sure which amp to buy consider this one. It pushes two 10"" dual voice coil subwoofers easily. I just wish I had another one for my high channel output.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Tedious. It's rare that I speed through a book solely for the purpose of getting to the end of it so I can throw it down and get to a better book, but this was certainly the case with ""Lunch"". This formula has been done before, more engagingly and intricately, by better writers. The author's attempt at provocation fails miserably and the book reads like an over-dramatized romance novel with a buffoon for a central character. The author also has a tendency to build up to nothing which I first noticed in ""Belladonna"", (which was, nevertheless, better written and more engaging than ""Lunch"", due to the narrator's viewpoint of the story and a more developed plot and central characters). This novel may have been quite the scandal if it were written in 1940, but it certainly doesn't cut it today. Lunch? No thanks.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Be sure to turn the knob on back of speaker to lower setting, unless you want an immediate visit from your neighbors. Even with low volume setting, the subwoofer provides appropriate bass notes -- like James Earl Jones talking softly. Cabinet is beautiful.",,1
