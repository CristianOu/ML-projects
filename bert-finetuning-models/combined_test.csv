TONE_POLARITY,"This is what might be called a ""light romance"" and not a screwball comedy at all. It's about a family of con artists that goes straight after encountering a generous old lady. The casting is poor. (It was nearly Gaynor's last film, for obvious reasons. Richard Carlson is wasted entirely, and Fairbanks is wholly unconvincing.) There are no laughs. Some of the sets are incredibly phony. And in the end the director had to rely on a parade of pups to generate good feelings. In short, this is a time waster, alarmingly out of step with the great comedies being made at the time. It's hard to believe that Selznik could be so clueless.",,0.0

This CD includes all solo exercises.Hal Leonard also offers (though not through Amazon) band sets for band directors. They are simple arrangements of music that correlate with the book.

Then about 15 minutes(or somewere around that) the movie took a downward spiral toward being a cheap, and not as ambitious as it looked like it was going to be.First of all the acting was bad, and a movie like this one proves how important good acting is to a very much talked about subject matter like this one.2nd of all the movie is not that realistic. I realize the things that Ed Gein really did were far out, but this film just lacks an imortant realisitic aspect to it. For example. In one sceen Ed Gein shoots a female baretender, then while she is still alive, Ed drags her accross the floor and puts her into his truck, and takes her home.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is easily the lousiest ""chic lit"" book I've read. The writing is bland and the characters are poorly fleshed out. More than once the author gets lazy and doesn't even bother to create a character herself but invokes a well-known character in pop culture and expects the reader to just insert that well-known character into her novel. For example, the main character is ""Sarah Jessica Parker, but prettier."" Her office mate is ""Lillith,"" from Cheers and the show Frazier.The main character is the least endearing of any I've seen in a ""chic lit"" book, which is a bad thing considering that so much of the pleasure of reading these novels hinges on the ride the main character takes the reader on.

This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller .,,0.0

The scent is definitely reminiscent of amoxicillin as well. The warmer the water, the easier it dissolves, but the more pronounced the aftertaste becomes.My personal solution has been to mix with hot tap water and an immersion blender, followed by addition of some ice mixed to a slushy consistency; then gently stir in enough lukewarm water to bring it to a temperature you can comfortably just chug-down-and-get-it-over-with. The alternative, for an additional 150 calories or so is to dump in a container of Chobani greek yogurt with fruit and blend to the consistency of a ""smoothy""; the pomegranate and blueberry flavors mask the amoxicillin aftertaste best.Realistically, this is a flavor that can lived with day in, day out, without retching.",,1.0

So, when I found out that Michael Ball had made a ""country"" album, my curiosity was piqued.First of all, this is not country music. These are covers of songs originally recorded by country artists. This CD would not be considered country in Nashville, Minneapolis, Branson or even Vegas. The last, however, seems the most likely home for this CD. Gone is the simple and clear emotional renderings of the original artists. Instead, the sorry souls listening are subjected to over-orchestrated arrangements created, to my best guess, to hide the fact that Mr. Ball's once incredible range has all but disappeared and years of smoking and vocal misuse have wreaked havoc on his vocal chords.",,0.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies, so when I saw this in Wal-Mart (on sale for only $9.00)...I figured I'd give it a chance. Bad idea. Not only did this movie have a ton of holes in the plot and continuity issues, it looks like it was filmed with a home video camera. It's seriously bad. No redeeming qualities whatsoever...except for the fact that you'll probably get a few good laughs out of it. The acting is terrible, the effects are pretty ridiculous, and it's so cliche it'll make you sick. Avoid at all costs!",,0.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I read the previous reviews and ordered a SpotBot, which arrived last week. I cannot believe how good it works! It took care of (excuse my candor) cat vomit stains from an off-white and a mauve carpet, with no problem. (We have three cats with stomachs that must be more delicate than the garden-variety kitty, because it seems like they do it alot....)We also used the SpotBot to remove a dark stain that was left on the mauve carpeting by the leg of a brass bed - it was really deep and imbedded. I was amazed!This cleaner isn't for all-over carpet cleaning. But it is wonderful for little (and not so little) spots and stains, without using elbow grease! And the price from Amazon (with $$$ off and free shipping) was about $25 less than I could buy it for from our local Wal-Mart)I'll never put off cleaning up those stains again!I am so satisfied!",,1.0

The sea battles are nothing to brag about as they are boring as well except they have more noise when a ship blows up. Got to the end of this game and thought, ""wow, I never knew it was so cool to be bored.""Same enemies over and over again, except at sea, as the game progresses, one runs into more and more ships.But on the upside, the game is like a Disney trip. At Disney land, you can stand in a long line and be bored and when you get to your ride, you are too tired to be excited. Same in this game, spend all day running around and when you get into a battle it is so boring that you might feel like saying, ""wow, this is so cool to be bored.""This game wouldn't hold the attention of a 4 year old. In fact this game made me think I had ADD.Rent this first, and then if you think it is cool to be bored, buy it.",,0.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this toy for our new adopted kitten (10 weeks old when we got him). I didn't know if he would play with it or be scared of it, but he took to it right away, batting at the ball and chasing it around the track. It took him about a week to figure out that he could scratch on it, but once he did, he scratches on it for a while every day.The best thing that we figured out is to make a small tent out of cardboard (just fold a piece in half) and cover the ball with the tent. Our kitten goes crazy every single time we do it, he can't stand when the ball is ""hiding"" under the cardboard.I'm giving this toy 4 stars instead of 5 because it slides like crazy around our hardwood laminate floors. We put a small kitchen towel under it, and that reduces the sliding somewhat. They should really provide rubber feet or some other grippy surface to stick on the bottom for those of us who need to use it on non-carpeted surfaces.",,1.0
