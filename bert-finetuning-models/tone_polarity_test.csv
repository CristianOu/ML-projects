TONE_POLARITY,"I must preface this by saying that I am not religious - but I loved this book. I really enjoyed the story it was telling. To me this is more a story about where we come from as women, rather than some religious/biblical treatise. Reading this book you can really feel a connection with the character Dinah and the writer brings to life her world with colorful vividness. This book has an almost feminist feeling and to my great amusement paints Jacob as a villainous man who personifies most of the worst qualities one can have. This story sucked me in and I read it practically in one sitting. It was one of the best books I have read in a while.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As a big time, long term Trevanian fan, I was extremely disappointed in this ""experiment"" by the author. I deem this effort an experiment since it is so unlike anything ""Trev"" (as his fans call him) has ever written before. Plain flat-out boring! It's almost as if Jane Austen had attempted to write a Twilight Zone episode under the influence of Sominex.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This album is hot as it wants to be. However Cash Moneys best album ever is Turks Young and Thuggin. So better luck next time Wayne,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I read this book when I was in elementary school- probably fourth grade. I read a lot of books, but this one stuck with me and I still consider it to be one of my favorites. I just recently remembered the title (after seeing crows out my window) and may have to buy myself a copy.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Although this book is touted on several Anusara web sites as a book about Anusara, I found it to be more about self-loathing and a poor body image. From cover to cover, the author rehashed her, and other's, disfunctions and poor self-esteem related to a poor body image and eating disorders.Now, if you fall into any of the afore mentioned catagories, you may find this book for you. If not, it's a waste of time. (I too have looked in the mirror during a yoga session and thought, jeez, I'm going to have to not eat for the next month...., but I didn't dwell on it. And I don't consider a new pedicure when gazing at my feet in down dog.)My truly, heart felt advice to those of you whom this book will speak to is, spend less time on the mat and more in meditation, until you get your mind under control. I am saddened for anyone who is their own worst enemy. Life is too short.Yoga, and all it's attendant traditions, are so much more. Let it be so for you.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This was the very worst DVD that I have ever purchased. The technical quality was so bad that Fisher's features were unrecognizable. Musical tone production was simply atrocious. I could go on and on but really do not feel like wasting any more time on this piece of crap. Why does Amazon even put something this bad on the market for sale? I would really, really like my $$$ back, Amazon. Your faithful customers deserve far, far better from you. The back of the DVD cover says it all: ""THIS DVD IS NOT ENDORSED BY EDDIE FISHER."" Only five copies left?? If you have any mercy on your customers and you care about preserving your reputation as a reputable dealer of halfway marketable products, you will withdraw them immediately. To sell something this horrible is, in my opinion, disreputable and a disgrace to your reputation.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I wasn't sure if I should upgrade and spend $80 on a nice window fan, so I decided to risk it and go for something a little more low budget. This isn't the strongest fan in the world, but it does suck enough air in from outside to cool my bedroom down. Not super noisy or difficult to use. For the price, I'm pretty happy with my purchase.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"At the beginning of this, my first year of law school, I didn't think too much about my actual casebooks. After a couple months, I began to think more about their layout, the organization, case notes, questions, indexes, etc. I began to have favorites, and some that I was less fond of. But until I saw this casebook, I didn't realize casebooks could be so awful. This casebook is badly in need or further organization, better headings, a better table of contents, better editing - in short, all of the details that make or break a casebook.Just to be clear, I am reviewing the second edition, published in 2009. I have also seen the first edition, and the best I can say is that this is, in fact, a significant improvement over the first attempt. But it has a long way to go before any 1L is going to be happy with it.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Sad to say, Jason and his sidemen do not swing on this disk, and one might deduce from its quality that they don't swing anywhere else, either. Their stated ethic is admirable. But the good words don't stand in for good playing, and there is precious little of that on this album. The pianist plays passably, however.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This was a very disappointing book.Examples are simplistic and not well thought out. There are very basic shells for doing some parsing tasks a lot of different ways, but very shallow or missing rationale for the different alternatives. It felt like the author came up with a bunch of solutions without understanding the problems XML can address. Having E-Commerce in the title is a joke that hangs on one of the recurring examples throughout the book.Numerous gramatical and content errors. The structure of the book is light as well - examples before concepts and lots of white space & big type.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This chair claims to be for ages 3 to 8, but my 5-year-old barely fits on it. I bought it to go with his kid sized desk, but this chair is so little that he has to reach up for the keyboard. The chair is probably fine for 3 to 4-year-olds, but that is about it. It does go together easily and is lightweight, so it does make a nice chair for the right sized child. The price is right, but unfortunately, that means I'm stuck with a pint sized chair because it is not worth the expense of return shipping. Very disappointed. I would not have ordered it had the description been accurate!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I got today the HSF and replaced the original HSF with the SILET BOOST RX. Don't be fooled. It is not silet by any means. I would say it is even louder than the original stock fan.

TONE_POLARITY,"To be honest, I was stunned by this album. The singing is just unspeakably bad!

TONE_POLARITY,"I got this frame as a Mother's Day present for my mom. I loaded up an SD card and installed it for her. It's very easy to set up and use. But I was very disappointed to discover that even though it is a wide-screen viewer (modes for aspect ratio of 4:3 and 16:9), the 16:9 mode is COMPLETELY USELESS!! It STRETCHES regular images to make them fit the screen. What kind of idiot thought of that??? I have a bunch of panoramic pics from our family reunion I wanted to be able to display in the full wide-screen mode, but since they're only displayable in 4:3 mode, they shrink down to fit within the smaller dimensions which makes it hard to see the detail.If not for that one major problem, this would have been a great gift for Mom.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I'm a fan of the Dark series Ms. Feehan has written. Unfortunately, I'm just going to be blunt and say that this book bored me. It's almost as if she was bored herself writing this book. I got it sometime last year, got through half of it and haven't finished it yet, and I've never done that with a book in my entire life. This is something I would not suggest for anyone to buy.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is the first book by Billy Collins that I have read, and so I must admit that my opinion may be relatively uninformed, although I think it is safe enough to assume that this is a fair representation of his work thus far. It seems to me that Collins' preoccupation with accessibility has overpowered his poetry, if indeed the contents of this book can be said to be poems at all, rather than cut-up prose. Dullness is the recurring characteristic of the collection, and the famous Collins charm wears thin very quickly. The value of poetry lies in how something is said, rather than what is said, and Sailing Alone Around the Room does not provide that value.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"It was a great read. Sexy, fun and a little out there. If you like mythology it's a must read.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This already short book should be about 50 pages shorter yet. It is laced with repeated quotes, phrases, and facts. The first time you read that Churchill carried a lance in one of history's last cavalry charges, it's fascinating. The second time, it's a surprise to see the statement repeated almost verbatim. The third time, it's an insult.Again and again (and again), this pattern is repeated. On one page, the same clause from a Churchill quote appears three times. Enough already. It's bad enough that the writer made this mistake, but it's unforgivable for the editor to let it pass for publication in this shape. By paring 50 pages off the manuscript, it would be just what it claims to be -- not a bad short rehash of the existing Churchill biographies.Save your money. Get another Churchill biography.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I'm using this with a 400gb Western Digital harddrive on Windows XP system. First, I had hard time formatting and partitioning the drive with this case using native Windows XP tools. I finally used some commercial software. I transferred a lot of files into the harddrive via this case but there are too many file corruptions. I almost lost my important data, fortunately I had backup in DVD. Between the famous and reliable harddrive and this made-in-china case, naturally I think it's this drive that responsible for the file corruptions.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This book showed some promise in the beggining. It didn't come true.Arien Mirida thinks he's cursed. His bride was killed by beasts gathered by an ancient curse he didn't know about at the time (and later his aunt managed to tell him about). So Arien decided he'll live unhappily ever after - until he discovers hope exists.Enter Cat Sabledrake. She falls inlove with Arien and helps him destroy the curse. Then she helps him resurrect his bride, and they part, unhappy again.So what's the catch?!I liked this book until I realized it was setting the course for a whole series, with Cat Sabledrake as main character. Well, I for one, won't read the rest of them. The one I liked, Arien, won't be re-appearing, so why follow all Cat's bad choices of lovers?! If it's true love, let it be free... at least in a fantasy novel, love should be true.Not in this one, though. Not to the end.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The really standout feature of this book for me is how easy and fun it is to read. I consider myself fairly capable and passably fluent in conversational Spanish, but not only did I learn completely new and unexpected phrases and colloquial vocabulary in Spanish that had previously been beyond me, but Pepa and Pili (the main characters in the dialogues) had me chuckling and at times guffawing throughout. The author has a great sense of humor and a flair for refreshingly real-sounding conversation - not the stilted repartee you usually see in language books.After reading this book you will no longer need to sneak peaks at the subtitles during Almodovar movies. This book is great fun to read and the exercises are quite challenging - a real help in moving your Spanish past the text book into the real world.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is very scary and very creepy..especially to me, someone who has paid lip service to Christ all his life but never really started to pay attention until a few months ago... for me it is a direct indication of where I could've fallen all too easily had I not made some good decisions...

TONE_POLARITY,Dont buy this book! I purchased this book liking some of the recipes but I soon realized what a mistake it was. Not only dose the book barely go into detail about what you'll need for each recipe but most of the recipes in the book you can make yourself. You dont need a recipe to tell you how to make nachos.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I stopped reading this book way before the end because I could no longer stand the pretentious and self obsessed author. The book is less plotand more of the author's ode to self. I wasted my money on this book. It is so boring. Unless you care about how smart the author thinks she is, what books she has read, how attractive she thinks she is, ect. then don't buy this book. I am disgusted by her arrogance. I am shocked anyone could possibly find her attractive or interesting at all, much less as much as she herself does. I would not recommend this book to anyone.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Carl Sagan has done a good job of popularizing a sciences such as astronomy and physics and making them accessible to non-scientists like myself. The plot in the book is sort of cool but it just seem overly simplistic.Also, the characters were AWFUL. Just devices to carry the plot. I found myself not caring about a single one of them. Some of them were downright ridiculous. I'm glad that generally, Sagan stuck to non-ficton.There's better stuff out there.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I recently purchased the DVD ""Betty Broderick: A Woman Scorned"", as I have enjoyed this well acted movie on the Lifetime Channel.To my surprise, this DVD has two movies on it. The first movie of the Betty Broderick story ""A Woman Scorned"" and the Sequel called ""Her Final Fury"". A total of 3 hours on this DVD! I also noticed that there is a special section on the DVD where you can see the real Betty Broderick and watch some of her actual testimony at the murder trial. Very interesting. I recommend this DVD highly. This is for anyone who enjoys movies bases on real life incidents, crimes and murders.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this on paperback a little while back, and thought it was a good read. Since I plan to get my sister a Kindle for her birthday, I thought I'd gift this with it. Then I noticed something: THE KINDLE VERSION IS ALMOST TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS THE PAPERBACK VERSION!!!The cost of a printed book includes the price of making the paper, printing, binding, packaging for retail distribution, and in Amazon's case, packaging and shipping to the customer. The cost of an eBook includes NONE OF THIS, and the cost of hosting and bandwidth for distribution of each eBook, especially when divided into the massive number sold by Amazon, is nothing compared to the printing costs mentioned above. Right now, I do NOT plan to purchase this along with my sister's Kindle. In fact, as this seems to be a growing trend on Amazon, I may decide not to get her a Kindle at all.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,I purchased the Soleus and it quit drawing water from the air in the first 6 mos. The Soleus service rep chuckled as she advised me to just buy a new one since shipping and minimum service charges would be substantial [...] bucks plus when you throw in the parts - like how else can you fix it - without parts?

TONE_POLARITY,I purchased an easel for my granddaughter for Christmas. I also purchased pads of easel paper and the deluxe companion easel set from Melissa & Doug. The purchases arrived in speedy time and were overpackaged so there was no need to worry about anything breaking. The paper and art supplies arrived just as advertised. I am so happy that I bought the companion set. My granddaughter was able to use her easel immediately rather than running to the store for crayons & paint & brushes. There's much less mess because each paint brush has a cup with matching color lid. My daughter-in-law says it was an excellent purchase!,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"One of the first things you notice about this CD is that the violinist is not close miked. Instead, the excellent sound engineering places him in the orchestral context, while everything he does remains full toned and clear sounding. The performance of the first concerto might put you in mind of the Berg Concerto. It is full of yearning and late Romanticism, although these feelings are never overdone. The second concerto is served by a performance that brings out all the majesty of the work. I'm still very fond of Henryk Szeryng's recording and, on Hungaroton, Denes Kovacs's. Nevertheless, this CD documents an important Hungarian artist, Gyorgy Pauk, in essential works of his great countryman, and thus has important documentary value in addition to the musical pleasure it gives.",,1

Thought I'd try it, as shipping changes the dynamics of an exchange. It does a nice job, is light-weight, but you have to use more product. The result is nice body and natural shine.

TONE_POLARITY,"I have tried several low priced compressors for use as inflating the tires on my Ford F350. Most of them either take forever or simply cannot handle the pressure. I have even burned several of them out. The MV50, however, is strong and fast and easily up to the task. There are only two drawbacks: The unconventional tire inflator fitting on the end of the hose can be difficult to use depending on wheel configuration. I would have preferred a more traditional fitting, especially with a reverse ""truck chuck"" on it. The only other problem is the cord is too short. This unit must be attached to your vehicle's battery and the cord will not permit inflation of the rear tires on my F350 crew cab with the 8 foot bed. that being said, its easy enough to just hook up jumper cables to bridge that gap, plus most vehicles are not as long as mine anyway.

Imagine if Tom Clancy wrote a romance novel, or if Stephen King wrote a children's book...get the picture?The plot was typical of SF movies of the 1950s and 70s: Super advanced plant people crash on Earth and a super secret group of world-dominating CEOs try to kill all the witnesses. The aliens want us to clean up our act, the conspiracy group wants to drill for oil in the protected Alaskan wilderness...hey, wait a minute...There is an important lesson given by Mr. Sheldon in this book: Sidney doesn't write good science fiction.",,0

What I like is that it is attractive, has an automatic shut-off switch, heats the water quickly, is cordless and does not take up too much counter space in my small kitchen. What I don't like is that the measuring window is difficult to see because it is hidden behind the handle and it is very, in my opinion, loud while heating the water. The noise bothers me the most. The pros outway the cons therefore, go for it. :-)",,1

I lost 14 of my tropical because I didn't realize how sensitive they are to water conditions. So I checked Amazon.com to see if I could find a decent water testing kit that didn't cost $50 to $80. Amazon had my kit and the best price around.This kit allows you to test for Ph balance, ammonia and Nitrites in your aquarium water.

I gave my copy of his first solo album away, and I won't spend my money for this one. Why? to have one of the most soulful voices I've heard (fantastic when the Bro./Sis. act was together)I just don't understand why such a vocal talent has to be wasted on such shallow material.He follows in a long tradition of great male gospel soloists such as Prof. Alex Bradford, and Rev. James Cleveland, and If he does want to do ""love"" songs, he could follow the tradition set by Teddy Pendergrass.

I first noticed that the light was 'somewhat' dim but, not having too much experience with LED flashlights, I accepted this as 'normal'. I had the occasional reported problem with not lighting and having to shake the light or unscrew/re-screw the base to get it to work. Recently I decided to change the batteries (to a ""brand name"" battery) in all the units and what a surprise......all the lights were MUCH brighter than with the original batteries , except one, and the exception was that the acid had leaked from the batteries and ruined the contacts. My bottom line: all the 9-LED lights offered by different manufactures are probably the same, but the batteries make the difference. If you get these, throw away the included batteries and put three name brand ones in and be happy with your purchase.",,1

Takes place in N.Y, a model Alison Parker decides she needs some time away from her boyfriend, Michael(Chris Sharandon) Alison, finds a cheap rent in this old brick apartment building. There are strange people who occupy the building, like a priest who sits staring out the window day and night. There are all other sorts of creepy people who live in the building, that Alison meets. What's scary is that, when she calls the realitor to complain about the noise in the apartment above hers...the realitor tells her no one but the priest lives in her building!!! Alison goes on a strange downward spiral after that, and the creepiest things start to happen to her. This movie made it on Bravo's Scariest Movies Top 100! It is a classic horror story!",,1

Within the first year I replaced the on/off switch, which was covered by warranty and confirmed by my local vacuum parts dealer as a common problem with the Hoover WindTunnel. A few months later, after warranty expired, the dirt finder stopped working and the vacuum does not seem to be sucking enough because it cannot pick up fine dirt (like thread) from the carpet no matter what the height adjustment. Then the on/off switch broke again. This time I purchased the part and replaced myself because it was not under warranty and, in my opinion, not worth the cost of labor quoted.

I was tired of dragging a cord around my yard - that would reach everything. I didn't want the weight or maintenance of a gas trimmer. I don't have a ton to trim so the battery life has been fine.

One scene that kind of was scary was when the bad guys were going to eat a baby. That is kind of disturbing to any one who is human hopefully.

If you want to success in nowadays environment, you really need to have clear ideas, with strong basis, easy to understand by others and with minimal possibility to get lost in the execution stage.Heath brothers made a profound research about the 'ingredients' of successful ideas, and in this book they share their findings, moreover, they teach you how to apply this principles in you daily life so your ideas can reach a high level of achievement.I believe that this book will become a classic and a it will be a basic reading, just because good ideas increasingly rules who wins.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Lately Disney is making wrong choices with their shows. Zorro is a well loved series, and very much popular. You'd think that when Disney put this series on dvd, that it would be on sale for 2-4 years or so. I know there is a profit in selling the box set. So why did Disney decided to sell the set for a limited of 30,000??? That makes no sense. The box set came out in Nov 09, and 3-4 months later it's already Out Of Print. Seems pointless to sell the series, and then discontinue it so short of time. Very disappointing.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I noticed this one got a lot of bad reviews - people talking about how Laymon's works published after his death weren't that good.I disagree - I liked this one. The main character Melvin is about as creepy as they come. Laymon does a nice job characterizing him and letting you know what is going on inside his head. There were a few times I actually laughed out loud over some of the things he said or did, only to cringe a paragraph later when he did something unexpected. It is nice to find a book where a character elicits that kind of response.The plot isn't very deep - this is more of a fun, easy read. So don't over analyze it - just go into the experience to have a good time and a few inappropriate laughs, and you'll like the book.The Kindle edition is put together very nicely. Margins are the right size, didn't find spelling errors, etc. Some of Laymon's works seem a little rushed with the Kindle editions, but this one is in good shape.",,1

Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) scripts the first arc, which is the main highlight here as Cap fights off against the Red Skull and the usual array of rogues. The Captain America & Falcon story is nothing special though, even though Modok makes an appearance (and every Marvel fanboy knows he's worth a laugh or two). The art in both collections is solid, and Kirkman's story makes this volume worth picking up for Cap fans. Captain America is getting relaunched yet again though, under the helm of Ed Brubaker, which is also worth picking up.",,1

One chapter hardly relates to another, and all the ads at the back made me feel like this author just threw anything out there just to get an opportunity to sell me something else which I found personally offensive. The bottom line on this confused melange is that the book is so poorly put together and badly written that it's an insult to readers. The Radical Forgiveness theories are not only, not original, but also very hopeless because the author advocates that we are not responsible for anything that happens. The book's title is also a rip-off of the book, ""Radical Honesty.""

You can turn off the rotating brush, which is great for tile. It's got a HEPA filter (I mentioned our animals, right?) which makes me feel like our air's maybe a bit better than it would be.

Needless to say, I won't be restocking this item in my medicine cabinet since I never saw an improvement in my skin while using it. I'm still using Active Moist as my general facial moisturizer.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I buy this book for all my friends who are new parents. It is the definitive book on solving sleep issues - Dr Mindell's has written a scientifically sound book that is accessible and reasonable. The thing I like best about it is that it gives parents choices and the opportunity to actually ""parent"" their children to sleep, rather than just parrot a checklist of what you should or shouldn't do. I also find it to be very easy to read, which is just as important, especially when you are at the end of your rope and sleep deprived.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,This page turner displays Anderson's wonderful capabilities for writing science fiction and fantacy masterpieces,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This is an outstanding book that should be read by both expectant parents. It discusses not to raise a child that is how an A student, great athlete, or future world leader, but rather how to raise a student who does well in school, life, and society.Mr. White interviewed parents from different cultures and child rearing methods and gives the reader straight advise on methods to improve your child's chances for success in their life ahead. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready to have their first and also as a re-read to those working on their second, third, etc. A definite must!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I can relate to Sutherland's role as a bitter old man with Parkinson's. My father is in this very condition and the Donald plays it perfectly.

TONE_POLARITY,"I do like this album - there's something about Mirwais' in-your-face-bass that really hits the spot. The difference in styles between the various co-producers on each track is particularly noticeable - overall, however, I would say that this is an album that is poignant while remaining strikingly simple.For those who criticise ""mindless drum machines"", I put forward what I remember of a quote by Bjork. She said that, if the music has ""no soul"", people tend to point the finger at the computer. However, Bjork suggests computers are just a tool, like guitars or pianos. If the music has no soul, that is because no one has put it there - it's not the fault of the computer.I believe that Madonna given this album a soul. You decide for yourself.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Okay, Tom is one of those artists who's music transfers well to almost anyone's interpretation. They are just damn good songs, and it's hard to mess up a good song. But listening to this music is like hearing Tom Waits emasculated, or maybe a Stepford Tom Waits. Hammond's voice and delivery doesn't even approach the pathos or spirit of Tom's. Sure it has a nice ""Blues groove"", but the spirit of Waits is lost in this recording. If Tom's music is smoked brandy,this music is a blended daiquiri with a paper umbrella. Holly Cole, who is, sometimes, so upbeat I want to slap her, gives a much more sensitive, gritty, and moving performance of Waits' songs than this Julie-Andrews-Guy. If you want mediocrity, buy this cd. If you want artistry, pass it by.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Clearly, the web as we know it will only become more and more ingrained in our businesses and our society. As a relative neophyte to the Internet space I found this book to be invaluable in developing a better understanding of web development. Probably, the best thing about the book was its focus on practical applications and real world examples. The Internet of the 1990's was filled with industry jargon and pie in the sky ideas that have gone the way of the dodo (and Internet stocks sky high valuations). If someone is looking for how to develop a web site the right way, right away then this book is a great place to start.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The Intention Experiment is a great book to explain a powerful force that has been known by humans for thousands of years. Now 'science' can confirm it. Truly this is not 'new' - but that is not an attack on the author or the book - they deserved full marks (and its a great read) - what is interesting is the fact that this is the discovery of how manifesting works, which was taught by Wattles, Haanel, Edison, Hill, etc wrote about and taught for so many years.You can understand why/how it works with 'The Intention Experiment', but if you want a set of instructions on how it works just for you to get what you desire - just go back to the source:Think And Grow Rich: The Personal Study EditionThe Master Key System: The Personal Study EditionPath To Prosperity - Mastery Of Destiny - Acres Of Diamonds: The Personal Study EditionThe Science of Getting Rich: The Movie - 2 Disk Set",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is perfect for advanced beginners who are ready to continue disciplining their game. The slow building of complexity, the ordering of patterns, and the perfectly framed problems make this book hugely useful. Less experienced players be warned, however; Davies often boldly pronounces many statements that would be self-evident to more advanced players, but which may be more cryptic for starting players. Consider the perfunctory ""Since each half of the white group touches both of the internal liberties, White is alive"" (page 17). Having studied the problem, laid it out on the board, and worked through variations, I am pleased to say I NOW understand precisely what Davies means (and I'm a far better player for it, given the ubiquity of this arrangement). But without a board and stones nearby and some patience, this statement would have required more textual explanation for someone at my level (maybe 13 kyu?). In other words, prepare to GET TO WORK to improve your game.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Book was recommended to me because it had some very interesting parallels to the Iraq War. It's old Heinlein and even old sci-fi so the writing style drips of this. A very ""ok"" book with only a couple scenes that I thought were extremely well written. But liked some of the attitude of the characters as they were very realistic to being in a war. But overall a book you can definitely skip.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"It was an evening's entertainment. If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention. The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen. I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all. She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion. The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I loved this earrings. When i purchased them i read everyones reviews first and i thought they where going to be too big. Not at all!.

Also the price is way too good to say no.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This movie was incredibly slow. I fell asleep twice. If you are going to go based on the good reviews, rent it first and decide if you want to buy it. I will do that from now on with these independent films that are rated high. What a let down. The acting was ok, filming was a bit wobbly, and the story was good. What made this real boring was the narration from the main character. They were trying to fill in the blanks. Maybe it would have been worse if they didn't. Overall, I did not like it.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Over the years, I'd heard snippets of the story of 5 missionaries who were killed trying to reach a tribe of people civilization had not touched. I finally purchased the book, and could hardly put it down. I learned how hard it is to be a missionary - all the things you must do in addition to sharing God's love. I was amazed at the dedication the men had to reach these people, knowing they might lose their lives. I was also amazed at the peace the wives had once they learned of their husbands' deaths.

I highly recommend this book, and it doesn't matter much if you like the main character, she is interesting.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I loved the first 150 pages of this book. The characters were fun and the settings were interesting. Everything was great until the hero and heroine met. Then the whole book went south.The Rest of the book is about Derek's desire to have sex with Chantelle. And the sex is his only desire. He doesn't know anything about her and doesn't seem to care. He never even asks what her real name is, although he insists that she use his real name. He's manipulative, selfish, and pretty much 'seduces' her into the sex. (Where I come from that's called emotional rape.) I ended up hating him, and not understanding why she loved him. Frankly, I thought Chantelle would have been better off with one of the eunuchs.But of course he falls in love with her (falls in love with having sex, because they never have a conversation about anything else. How can you love a complete stranger?) and it all works out. Blah. I won't make the mistake of reading another Johanna Lindsey book.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I use this vacuum to clean up all kinds of messes I created in my work shop. It works great. It has a bit of a high pitched whine to it, but it is not nearly as bad as some of the negative reviews stated. It has excellent suction, and picks up sawdust, wood chips, metal drilling remnants, nails, screws, and all the other junk I drop on the floor or bench. The hose has two positions in the vacuum hose holder itself; one is just to hold the hose, and the other, if pushed all the way forward, is to run the vacuum scoop on the front of the vacuum. I think the people who complained about the power of this vacuum forgot to push the adaptor all the way forward to make an air tight hook up to the scoop. The weight and size makes it very handy, and it gets into all kinds of tight places. Best shop vac I have ever owned.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"By this, their third album, it was quite obvious that Flash were not going to give Yes a run for their money. In fact, Flash wouldn't even come close to matching Yes' commericial and artistic successes. A lame concept album about some guy from the Planet Catalina, Out Of Our Hands stumbles in the usual places: weak vocals, inane lyrics, lack of keyboards, etc. Why group leader/guitarist Peter Banks never bothered to replace Tony Kaye on keyboards after the first album is the head-scratcher here. Trying to do it all on guitar, Banks and band mates just can't seem to muster the musical depth to keep up with their prog-rock counterparts (although Banks' guitar work here is awesome, as usual). After this album, Banks retired Flash altogether and started a new band called Empire. They recorded three album's worth of material in the late '70s - none of which was ever released by a major label until just recently (on One Way).",,0

I would have rated this CD five stars if there had been at least one more new song.

They all live in a plague-decimated Earth in the 21st century. Aside from the everyday problems of a street teen, Jake has to take care of Evan as he gets steadily sicker, and defend Mellie from her father. When he finds the storyteller for a school project, he suddenly sees a glimmer of hope that could make Evan better.

TONE_POLARITY,"Let me be clear here: I did not have high expectations for a mandoline priced at about six bucks. Having said that, I did expect to be able to create reasonably simple cuts like french fries (if not superfine juliennes). But alas, it was not to happen: the blades and supports are so thin and flexible that getting even semi-even cuts is nearly impossible. Slices are noticably thicker on one end than the other, but the blade won't cut through a vegetable without a little pressure (which is what's warping the cuts).The hand-guard at least is better designed.In short, save your six bucks and either cut by hand or buy a real mandoline.

At this time, this cover doesn't even show signs of straining at the seams. This winter has not been particularly rough in PA, but I like what I see (or don't see) so far. And since the price is comparable to (in some cases even less than) those of vinyl covers, I would highly recommend this product over vinyl.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because it only has two straps to secure it to the chairs. Unfortunately, the elastic cord does not seem to keep the cover secure during high winds. It would be better if this particular size had six straps since it is designed for a six-chair table set.

My ""so far so good"" trick: When I store my wire whip, I put a bright green clothes peg on it. When I take the whip out for use, the peg gets clipped on to the front of the upper rack of my DW. When I am hurrying through cleanup, the peg reminds me not to put the whip in the DW and I immediately turn and hand wash the whip.

Even when one tries to draw a row of colors all the same, the slightest pressure in the wrong direction renders your efforts futile. The packaging dishonestyly beats the drum for the simplicity of this toy. After playing with it, most people are disappointed in what they can produce. If I could get my money back for this toy, I would.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Some of the bits are funny, but I just can't simply love this show no matter what. It relies far too much on beer drinking, farting and burping - and doesn't have the heart of The Simpons or the wit of King of the Hill. It tries to be witty by splicing in several references to 70's and 80's pop culture but these always feel forced and trivial. Many of the characters are plain annoying (Peter and Chris) while others are under-developed (Meg). Stewie is fairly funny but he's kind of a one note song (does the same things over and over and uses the same lines in every episode like 'what the deuce!'..funny the first time but repetitive very quickly). Brian the Dog can be VERY funny and simply needs more screentime as the Griffin Family's alcoholic pooch. 2 stars for some moments of levity.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I suppose my title tells it all. While I would go the distance to purchase a new Dylan item to listen to - this live recording at Budkoan leaves me nauseous. I am left wondering what Dylan and/or his promoters, were thinking about when they came up with this musical format. The 'up tempo' musical background coupled with Dylan's attempt to join in by adding his own uptemp vocal elements put simply, destroys the poetry of his songs! This is one live concert to be avoided - even by the collector!!!",,0

The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting.",,0

I must say I was pretty disappointed. I read the whole book in about an hour or two, and I got nothing out of it, the whole plot is pretty lame in general. It just seemed to lack the depth and [true to teen life] perspective that other popular teen books have these days. Some people liked the poem format, but I for one found it just annoying and distracting. It took away from the plot in my opinion. In general, the book seemed like a waste of time.",,0

The template does not work very well and you still have to set it up to a degree. For some reason Surething wont support Canon printers. They have lots of template's for Epsons but no Canons.

TONE_POLARITY,I'm a big real big fan of the Matrix. I'm 12 year's old and i'm a female. I think this movie is better than all the matrix 1 & 2. The first movie had a sense if I was really in a computer world control by machines. The second was a little better than the first. It had an other sense of Neo being in control of the matrix until Mr. Smith showed up.The third movie is more intense with lots action. It had all tight graphics. I really like the special efects that made this movie possible. It's to bad that this last part gave away A best ending to the trilogy of the Matrix.

Picture quality is what I would expect from a HDMI/DVI cable.A couple weeks later I purchased the same type of cable from Monoprice for use on my another triple monitor setup at my office. I found them to not only have a better build quality, and even a smaller guage wire (remember, smaller gauge = increased cable radius, thus better signal). The picture and video quality of the two cables were indistinguishable. The best part is the MP cables are a third the price (and even sold on Amazon).

TONE_POLARITY,"'Secret Window' definitely had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. It is filled with suspense and crazy plot turns. However, I found it to be rather cliche, in the sense that it was a total stereotype of a Steven King novel, even though that is what it was based upon. Or maybe not a stereotipical King plot, but almost a cliche 'scarey movie' line, where it's just an easy escape to have the main character be, well, crazy.Despite these vices, 'Secret Window' was still a rather good thriller, and I would recommend it, most definitely. Johnny Depp shines, as usual, and I've never seen him in such a creepy role.Overall: four stars!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Prior to purchasing this DVD, I heard many things about Forrest Yoga. All of it good. I bought the DVD and was initially not impressed with the poses I saw performed. Then I actually tried the workout and it was great. The poses performed on this DVD aren't anything a person with 2 or more years of experience could not perform. With that said, what makes this DVD solid, is the amount of time poses are held and the core abdominal work. For people who are used to vinyasa flow constant movement type yoga (like myself), this DVD is a nice alternative. Forrest Yoga is slower flowing yoga (compared to Ashtanga or Vinyasa Flow/Power Yoga) with more of an emphasis on holding poses for a longer period of time.

I disagree with the judgement that this book didn't allow the reader to ""see and feel"". I could see, hear, smell and feel the combat. Admittedly, I was a Marine Corps officer and trained to understand the writer's language. I was struck by the attention to and accuracy of details.

TONE_POLARITY,"My theory is that Ole Bornedal, whose 1994 Danish-language original ""Nattevagten"" was an instant classic of the serial-killer/suspense genre, was shown a large sum of $$$ to force out this turgid, soulless remake. It's almost a shot-by-shot, line-by-line retelling of the familiar 'whodunit' with a law student (the uncomfortable Ewan McGregor) being menaced by a serial killer during his nightwatch at a medical building. The character shading, smooth flow of events, and atmospheric chills have been replaced at the expense of visual finesse and inexplicable character motivation. Style over substance, much in the vein of those melarkey ""Scream"" films, and more than likely to snare in the kiddies.My two-star rating is based solely on the stylish re-creations of a few scenes, plus admirable performances from Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin, who give the dense material their all.

TONE_POLARITY,"With a great cast and an enemy you just love to hate this one just keeps on ticking. Kirk and his old enemy Khan butt heads over a device that can create planets called ""Genesis"". The only part I didn't like was when Dr. McCoy got all religious about the creation of planets. I know that he is a country doctor and that this is the point, but I just don't think it adds to the character. I only write this review knowing that if you don't know this already you are not a Star Trek fan. If this is the case I urge you to reconsider this movie is wonderful strictly for its entertainment value.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"""Blue Country Heart"" is absolutely outstanding! A great collection of musicians producing an awesome piece of work. In my humble opinion, Jorma's music was made for this combination of instruments. For it's great selection of songs and magic blend of strings and vocal harmonies, ""Blue Country Heart"" deserves to win a grammy, no questions asked.Jorma, thank you.

TONE_POLARITY,"I can't give this book an one star like I'd like to only because I finished it. You see, if it was truly awful I would not have got to the end at all. The only saving grace for me was the descriptions of the exotic lands this book took me to, Algeria and the Sahara Desert especially. The descriptions were much better than the story. Heck, the more I think of it, if I wanted descriptions of settings, I could have read a tour guide and have been entertained. I have changed my mind, I will rate it one star after all.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I've been burned by Microsoft twice before with Sidewinder joysticks. The first time I bought one was when I had Windows 98. It was a Sidewinder Pro. Great joystick, plug n play, all that. When I migrated to Windows 2000, I found that the Sidewinder Pro was not supported (despite being analog--you'd think it would be easy to program drivers for it). I thought, ""Okay, maybe there are problems, blah blah blah."" I then bought a Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro, again, great product, plug n play, all that. Worked great. When I migrated again to Windows XP I found AGAIN it wasn't supported by Microsoft. There is NO reason why a company such as Microsoft cannot support their own products on their own operating system. I will NEVER buy a Sidewinder again. I can't trust them. Buy anything else. I've had great luck with the Wingman Digital Extreme--$$$ at ......--excellent buy!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The only redeeming qualities of this movie is Catherine Zeta Jones' stunning face/body and some nice scenery. The scenes of the heist in Kuala Lampur as well as the Scottish castle scenes had some incredibly picturesque backgrounds. However, the plot is convoluted to the point where the ""tense"" moments lack suspense because the viewer is too confused to figure out what is going on. The director attempts to bombard the audience with plot twists but there are too many twists and turns that don't really seem to make any sense. The age difference between Connery and Jones detracts from the believability of their romance. If you're looking for a movie about a heist, go with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo in the Thomas Crown Affair.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This was very dissapointing. I expected a reality based novel, but it turned out to be a highly expanded tour book of sorts for the USN Submariners. A forced attempt at dropping as many names as possible so that they may take their due place on stage. Obvious bait for Hollywood.Lacks depth or any serious literary skill. Feels like one long newspaper interview. Especially lacking was mention of the moral aspects of having one's finger on the trigger of a doom's day machine. Hard to believe this never occupied any of the thoughts of the men and women manning these marvels of technology and dispensers of indiscriminant destruction. So little mention was actually made of the real hero that enabled these brave men to navigate with such ease in the endless oceans of our planet: 20th Century science and engineering.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm not by any means a crystal expert, but I knew that I wanted a set of nice wine glasses that were thin, well proportioned and had a stem, but weren't as expensive as Reidel. These fit the bill. The price is great - about $11/stem, and the quality is rather decent. Perhaps not quite up to the Reidel standard (one of my stems is a tad wobbly) but you can't beat the quality for the price. I really like the shape of the Atelier style too. They have some personality. I debated between these and the Spiegelau vino vino glasses.I ordered one set of four as a tester and am going to order 4 more of the cab/merlot glasses plus 8 of the reisling glasses. And if they break, which they inevitably will because I tend to drop things, it won't be the end of the world. What more can you ask for? And the packaging was great.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this toy for our new adopted kitten (10 weeks old when we got him). I didn't know if he would play with it or be scared of it, but he took to it right away, batting at the ball and chasing it around the track. It took him about a week to figure out that he could scratch on it, but once he did, he scratches on it for a while every day.The best thing that we figured out is to make a small tent out of cardboard (just fold a piece in half) and cover the ball with the tent. Our kitten goes crazy every single time we do it, he can't stand when the ball is ""hiding"" under the cardboard.I'm giving this toy 4 stars instead of 5 because it slides like crazy around our hardwood laminate floors. We put a small kitchen towel under it, and that reduces the sliding somewhat. They should really provide rubber feet or some other grippy surface to stick on the bottom for those of us who need to use it on non-carpeted surfaces.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I went and found this album because I love Rob Rock as a vocalist and have enjoyed everything he has sang on. Didn't know he sang on this until recently. Dude............it rocks. Awesome chunky metal riffs in your face. Great production and of course great vocals. No nu here this is modern heavy power metal. Not super fast but as solid as it gets. If you like Rob's solo stuff or his work on Impelletteri or just superb power metal hunt this down. Why is this hard to find? More talent here then any of the joker bands wearing masks. If it's not available here check out Rad Rockers. (can i say that here?),,1

TONE_POLARITY,"In my 30+ years of playing video games, Xenogears is one of the worst video game experiences of my life.About 80% of the ""gameplay"" is slowly advancing through text. And when I say slowly, I mean s...l...o...w...l...y. There is no option to speed up or skip the text - inexcusable for a game with this much text. Since they have put all their eggs into one basket - the story - if you don't like the story, you will not like this game.Except for a few boss battles, there is next to no strategy involved. If you do decide to get this game, follow a walkthough or use a boss strategy guide, since you don't want to be forced to sit through the same 15+ minutes of dialogue leading up to the battle.With this game, you are basically buying an expensive book.

I even put it on my hands and rubbed it into my eyes to make sure it was truly ""tear free"". In that respect, it's great. However, we've used it twice on our son. The first time (last weekend), he got a little bit red, but today, after being in the sun for only two hours, he's got the worst sunburn ever. I'm devastated since I'm very careful about his sun exposure (we're both fair-skinned). In the year and a half of using Water Babies, he NEVER had a sunburn.

So my husband and I spent the money for this wipe warmer and thought it would be worth it if it warmed the wipes as advertised. We were very disappointed.The wipes are barely even room temperature, but worse than that, they're wet! Water drips from the warmer when you open the lid. They also smell funny. We never used wipes from the warmer. I figured a cool, fresh wipe from the plastic wipe tub was better than a cool, wet, stinky one from an overpriced wipe warmer. And after a few days, our daughter Riley got used to cool wipes and she no longer complains.My advice: save your money.",,0

There's one wedding experience described that cost less than $2000 and one that cost nearly ten times that - with many others inbetween!

Hamilton's slow and steady descent into eroticism from day one.Don't expect to see new supernatural creatures like the Naga, Bloody Bones, or even Voodoo witches in this one, kids.

If the title character's quasi-religious epiphany at the end doesn't reach quite the heights of profundity the author clearly intended, it nevertheless evokes a powerful sense of empathy and pity from the reader. The antagonist's final actions before abruptly departing from the pages of the novel are mysterious indeed (a less polite reader might attribute this to the writer's clumsiness), but in some ways fit perfectly into the novel's existential scheme. An awfully good read.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This is what might be called a ""light romance"" and not a screwball comedy at all. It's about a family of con artists that goes straight after encountering a generous old lady. The casting is poor. (It was nearly Gaynor's last film, for obvious reasons. Richard Carlson is wasted entirely, and Fairbanks is wholly unconvincing.) There are no laughs. Some of the sets are incredibly phony. And in the end the director had to rely on a parade of pups to generate good feelings. In short, this is a time waster, alarmingly out of step with the great comedies being made at the time. It's hard to believe that Selznik could be so clueless.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"""Take Her To The Zoo"" is a seven song EP from Albany newcomers the VodkaSonics. The experience of former Subduing Mara bassist Brendan Slater and former Bloom drummer JJ ""Hollywood"" Hogan can't make up for the obvious inexperience of singer/guitarist/songwriter Seth Powell. These sound like they were probably the first seven songs he ever wrote, and the hooky basslines only attempt to disguise the near-total lack of personality in the rest of the music. I guess we can only hope that Powell goes out and listens to some Elvis Costello and the Attractions records (as Slater clearly has) before he writes his next record. There is a bright spot or two (hence the extra star). ""Knock Me Down"" is actually a bright , hooky pop tune that will more than likely stick with yoy, but from there on, you'll notice the similarities in each and every song. Sorry, guys, but you could do so much better.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is good if you're looking for something different. Lots of songs from the same thing (Oliver, Beatles, Elvis), but also a smattering of other ones. Even though there are a lot of the same faces, there are still a lot. It's going to take you a while to work your way through them anyway, and for the amount of songs there, it is a good deal. Good songs, too, just in case you're worried (i.e. no Mexican Hat Dance).",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader. From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes. He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds. Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points. While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student. All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well. The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings. However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Let me say this straight out... the movie is fictional. For me to try and understand, truly understand, how corrupt business and politicians have hijacked our foreign policy by watching this movie, would be like trying to understand the dogma of the Catholic church by watching another work of fiction, ""The Da Vinci Code"".Are we Americans so stupid in our understanding of international history, and the currents and eddies behind world events, they must be explained to us through fiction? If so, we deserve our current predicament, which should only worsen our ignorance.I challenge filmmakers to educate us with accurate portrayals of history. OK, so these movies may not have headliner opening weekends. But truth will educate throughout the years, and a movie true to history will continue to teach even when it sits on the DVD",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Pantera's second non-hair metal album, and not aaa bad one. Phil's vox on this album have become a might too monochromatic and aggro, when compared to Cowboys from Hell, though. The songwriting is similarly more catered to the aggro crowd than on Cowboys. Don't get me wrong, Pantera's thrash sesibilities are stronger than the nineties mallcore leanings by far, but the riffs are just a might too simple and chunky. Dimebag's leads are quite impressive, the man had a gift for pinch harmonics. Overall, a good but not great release.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"By my count there are about 6 or 7 Harvest Moon games out there for various systems, so Natsume must be doing something right. In fact, they recently released number 3 for the Gameboy Color.On Save the Homeland, the graphics are much improved (obviously) from any other version on the market. I have been playing it now for just a couple days, and I am already hooked. From what I read, the game focuses more on interaction with the townspeople than it does making money. I don't really agree with this; making money seems to be the primary goal. Plus, the people that I keep running into on an (hourly) basis don't have a whole lot to say or do. They are just sort of roaming around, and tell you some little cheesy statement about life.I do have one question; where in the...is the dog food?",,1

All the details are super delightful, from aquiring 'young 'ens' to getting a 'rig' and getting married (and divorced and remarried) the options are endless, you'll never have the same journey twice. The game even offers suggestions on different ways to play and an expansion pack which offers even more options. By far the best game I've purchased, I reccomend it to anyone who wants a laughter filled, light hearted evening.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This CD is a disgrace to loyalty!I like the beats Eminem made, but they didnt fit the vocals. He either slowed down or sped up Tupac's voice to match whatever beats he wanted to use.Ghetto Gospel is one of the worst songs on the whole album. The voice is so slowed down and more than 70% of it is missing from the original, whats up with that?Not to mention in the song Loyal To The Game. He takes out the 2 original people and adds G-Unit? What the ****? All that song sounds like is mis-matching verses that have nothing in common.Don't buy it, it isnt worth it. If you REALLY want it, download it, but don't give Tupac's mother any money. I can't believe she allowed this to happen. This is the worst CD ever put out in Tupac's name.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Back when bands were somehow able to make live recordings full of surprises, excitement, and occasional group improvisation, this one is a diamond in the rough. I've owned the vinyl for well nigh 25 years now, and the utterly unadorned sounds of the guitar, the bass, the drums, plus the howling voice of Paul Rodgers - why, it's primal blues rock at its sparest ... and most devastating. Andy Fraser's bass lines are lithe and kinetic. Paul Kossoff wrenches notes from the neck of his Les Paul in a style that still sets him apart from all who have followed. He left us far too soon. Only complaint is the haphazard rendition of ""All Right Now"" - (they were probably sick of it by then).",,1

TONE_POLARITY,This is a real treat for anyone who loves Comics. The special features alone were worth the movie price. Mark Hamill really gave a heart felt love letter to the Comic Fans. I really enjoyed picking out the voice over talents of some of my favorite cartoon stars as well. Mark truley hired a great grup of men and women who are all talents we dont get to see infront of a camera and gave them a plat form to do their stuff. His integration of the fictional comic book charater in to a real life comic book convention was fantastic. And of course it is always great to see Kevin Smith and Stan Lee.I believe everyone who loves comics as I do will get the inside jokes and the love of the industry and if you werent a comic fan before you just might be after you watch.Great job Mark!!!!,,0

This is a great video & a nice change from the traditional Sesame Street videos.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Some bands try to write songs that give the listener beautiful imagery that transports them into a different world or to a different age. Some succeed whereas some sacrifice melody to do so. Sam Beam, however, succeeds more than any recent artist that I can remember. There's a special feeling you get when you listen to it - it takes me back to a kid in simpler times during summer vacations where we would play outside for hours and be content laying on the grass and staring at the clouds. With his hushed vocals and sparse instrumentation, Iron and Wine sets the standard for bands to follow. Highlights include: On Your Wings, Naked As We Came, Sunset Soon Forgotten, Radio War, and Passing Afternoon. His voice sounds one part Elliott Smith, one part Sufjan Stevens, and one part Beck (in Sea Change). The best thing about this album is that it has a timeless feel to it, because it will always transport you to a different world.",,1

They watch many British TV shows and have difficulty understanding the dialog sometimes due to the accents. We thought two wireless headphones would be great. After extensive online research and reading all these raving reviews, we decided on this one. Unfortunately, no matter how hard we tried, we could not get both headphones working at the same time. My wife then read the whole instruction book. On page 20, in tiny fine print, it says ""This unit cannot be connected to multiple devices at the same time."" This is ridiculous! It renders the device utterly useless for our purpose, but the fact that it can only be paired with one headset at a time is hidden deep in the instruction manual. No warning given! We have wasted our money and are very, very, very disappointed.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"In the book ""Furacao Elis"" the author writes about the difficulty between Tom and Elis in recording this album, as both ideas of what the album should be, differed radically. Through the anger and joy in finding a collective idea as to what direction the album should be moving in, one can hear the range of emotions in each of the artist's voices. Elis Regina and Tom Jobim's ""Aguas De Marco"" is with all sincerity the most truly emotional and unpretentiously sophisticated song I have ever heard in my life, and for this it continues to be, in my opinion, the greatest work not only of Jobim, but of any of his contemporaries.--Taylor",,1

The pieces are drawn out to an extent where each note becomes a fragment that does not add up to a whole. The music of Satie thus becomes as unengaging as elevator music.Eric Satie was a restless and discontented innovator who barely had finished with one musical style until he moved on to the next. This tireless energy can be found in other recordings of Satie's music - most notably by Anne Queffelec - where even the most famous of Satie's composition, the slow Gymnopedies 1-3, reflect Satie's dynamic persona.In order to profoundly understand music and see it from the inside, it is necessary for the interpretor to understand its composer. This is not the case with De Leeuw.",,0

While it does portray a woman of extraordinary strength with courage etc., it also fails to make convincing the emotions between hero and heroine. They don't meet(in the flesh, so to speak) for way too long. Ms Howard's focus was definitely on Grace, not the relationship between the lovers, and I personally found that when they did meet, their love tended to be purely sexual. While I enjoy hot love scenes, it's certainly not to the exclusion of any of the finer feelings...I found this to be more a book about a woman discovering herself anew rather than a couple building towards a life together.

Fortunately, she's a clever little girl; equally fortunately, the giant is not clever at all.

So I can't use on of the dozens existing cables that I use for all other USB drives.The second thing I don't like is how the drive sits in the case. There is no way to secure the drive or have it rest on something int the case. It just plugs into the connector and then slides in the drive.

TONE_POLARITY,"I was never really much of a fan of Creed, although i did like some of their music. After seeing a commercial for this album i decided to give it a try. I was totally blown away by what i heard. New singer Myles Kennedy puts so much conviction and passion into his singing. His vocal range is unbelievable. And the remaining Creed members sound really tight playing their respective parts. Mark Tremonti really shines on this album, both by his playing and writing. If you're a fan of rock, buy this album. You won't be disappointed.",,1

I own over 100 blues CD's of various artists A to Z, and this one is the only one I wanted to throw in the trash before I even got through with it. You can not even get to hear the guitar because this mans voice is just absolutely aggravating. I can't even describe it. Is it screaming? But to tell you how I feel, I would rather listen to a jackhammer, or fog horn, going off repeatedly in my living room before I would ever play this CD again. I have to admit, I am no authority here, and I could be quite wrong about this CD, but take my advice for what its worth. And definitely buy something else.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I got the iMic as a higher-quality alternative to the cheap sound card on my XP laptop. For this purpose, it has worked great for me for the price. It has improved sound quality for both output (PC audio to stereo speakers) and input (I record voice from a cheap microphone for my work). To boot, since it's USB, I hooked it up to a USB 2.0 hub, so now I only need one wire to connect my laptop to all its peripherals.However, I agree with other reviewers that it's not quite a ""pro"" product -- it doesn't have the controls and connectors pro sound people are likely to want. And I also agree that the box's promise that it ""easily turns old records and tapes into mp3s or CDs"" is exaggeration. Of course, you need a sound card, such as the iMic, for that job, but in any circumstance creating those digital files will be a big labor.I'd recommend this if your basic goals don't go beyond just getting better sound.",,1

Took a little tweeking to get the two pieces aligned but went relatively smooth. Second issue, the packaging for transit sucks. Inside the box they designed the padding poorly (expanded styrofoam). One end had a large block of foam surrounding it the other had little padding at all and in turn one of the plastic foot pads was broken. I was able to make the repair in short order but this should never have happened. A full block of foam padding at both ends would have prevented this.",,1

The only thing the main character did was act like a freaking baby and the male lead, to say he was so smart, was so stupid. He felt he had to clean up all of her messes and in effect almost screwed up his own future. Her father repeatedly tells him that she will (but he won't listen). I waited throughout this entire movie for it to get good..... and it did... in the last 10 seconds.

For instance, he is very honest about the noise factor: dwarf parrots of all species can be raucous! The chapter on other popular dwarf parrots is necessarily abbreviated but informative enough to ""do"" until the reader could find a book on his particular pet.

Unfortunately, I can only rate this movie with 1-star, if I could give it a lower rating, I would. The dancing was pathetic, the acting was weak.... I could not connect with any of the characters it was just blah! I loved seeing Stephen Boss - Twitch (so you think you can dance) and Columbus Short, however it was not enough to make this movie good! Without a doubt the first movie was so much better. In the first movie the acting, dancing and story-line was really good. I like to support black movies and I am not sure who the writer, director and producer was on this movie.

Her voice has a yearning, passionate quality that forces you to take notice. Every single song on this CD has it's own personality. I am a lover of Hip-hop and R&B but I am dissappointed by a lot of the singers today because most don't have the talent, just the right look. But, Syleena Johnson clearly has both.

One young boy though has more interesting ideas ~ he daydreams of alien invasions and doing battle with Communist agents. When a local legend about a giant iron man proves to be real, the real threat is not from the Communists or aliens but the government. A story which pits a young boy against his feelings (good and bad), his friendship with a 50 foot iron giant, and the government he thinks he should believe. This is an excellent story for kids with mild violence. In the end the iron giant gives his life to save the young boy's town.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Like many other reviewers, I loved ""Daisy"" and expected better from this book. It's hard to warm up to a main character who refuses to enjoy the many advantages in her life (beauty, talent, success, wealth, popularity).""Baby Girl"" is the type of person we'd all want to shake in real life. In this book however, people can't stop falling all over themselves to do things for her (unappreciated I might add). I didn't find it especially funny, but the nostalgic sections did appeal and were very well done. Maybe it's a reflection of the author's southern heritage, but did she really have to supply ""Baby Girl"" with a thinly disguised ""mammy""? Would it have hurt the book if her psychiatrist had been tall, thin, Black and beautiful instead of an overweight Black woman who goes way beyond a professional attachment to her patient?",,0

The speed of the reading allowed for no digestion or comprehension of points , and soon was down right frustrating.

If you obsess (like I do) about getting the measure exactly right, these are unbeatable. They are obviously best for liquids but work for dry ingredients as well. They're dishwasher safe, but easy to clean by hand. My only gripe is that the ridge on the inside makes them a little trickier to scrape when you have a thick liquid like oil or buttermilk and you want to get all of it down to the last drop.

TONE_POLARITY,While the mountain is a nice centerpiece to a train layout. It is a little impractical since it is hard to layout track going through the middle level that doesnt interfere with track going in the bottom level. Also the middle level uses these little plastic tabs to support the track which have very quickly gotten bent/stretched so that the middle level supports dont work well anymore. This makes track connected to the middle level a little too low and results in trains getting stuck while going through the lower level. I am dissapointed in the quality of this item from learning curve. It needed to be a little taller so that trains could get through the bottom level without getting stuck and they should have had better support tabs for the middle level and you should be able to connect the two large sides together without the middle section. I would recommend looking around for the hill and mountain expansion set instead of this if you want mountains in your layout.,,0

In fact, these guys make Lithgow and Stallone look like Best Supporting Actor and Best Lead Actor candidates for their work in Cliffhanger (and Cliffhanger as Best Picture). On top of all else I didn't like about this movie, it was absurd to think about the rescue team running around at 25,000 feet without even breathing heavy (yet the guys taking it easy waiting for them were wasting away of edema). If you want a mountain movie, go with K-2, or just rent Everest (Imax).

However, as dazzling as the artwork is, the story leaves much to be desired. At all times purposely obscure, it is more than just a little difficult to follow. What begins as simply bewildering soon becomes annoying, a mindless tease for reasons unknown. What made this even worse was when the story was finally revealed it was so simplistic in nature that a mere sentence could sum it up: making this much ado about absolutely nothing. This is storytelling at its worse; barely above mindless rambling.The story: in a city where demons are forgotten by humans, a battle ensues to teach the humans a lesson and to bring an oppressor to power over all. Yeah, that's pretty much it, good against evil. No surprise who wins.Top marks for looks, zero for being incomprehensible. Won't put myself through another sitting, not a keeper.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"After reading the reviews here, I could not wait to see Rushmore. I tried to place the hype out of my mind while watching. I was thoroughly disappointed. Yes, Jason and Bill acted their parts well. But that isn't saying much considering their roles were those of completely unlikable people. The plot was lame lame lame and without merit. What troubles me even more is the number of people who would rate this film as a ""Classic"". Hogwash. The extras are interesting, but it is difficult to be interested in extras when the film is completely uninteresting to begin with. Rushmore was a dud. Watch it once.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is my first foray into the world of HD, and am I impressed! I have spent the last 1-2 years drooling over the technologies of Plasma vs. LCD, and right up until the end, I was leaning LCD. In the end I chose plasma due to my watching predominantly sports.Most reviews I read raved about the quality of the Panasonics, so I went with them, and I can say without a doubt, it was the right choice. The HD picture is flawless, and I like that there is a custom setting that I can use. Sound quality is also very good for TV speakers. And I definitely recommend using HDMI; if you can't tell the difference in quality from component, you'll at least appreciate having fewer cables to deal with. My only complaint is the usual: screen glare (this is the model without the anti-glare coating); but I knew that going in, so...not a big deal.Overall, I highly recommend this TV. It was a bargain at $999 with quality matching sets costing twice that.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"As a big fan of Faye Kellerman I was really looking forward tothis book being published. I bought it the day it came out. I washugely disappointed in it. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't well plotted and I was saddened by her choice to denigrate the Mormon faith. I have really loved reading her Rina Lazarus books and learning about the Jewish faith. I have respected the character of Rina Lazarus and her devotion. So I was quite surprised that Faye Kellerman could show such a lack of respect to another faith. It was also factually incorrect, in one scene she describes a Mormon girl at her first communion wearing a cross necklace. Mormons do not celebrate first communion, and they never use the symbol of the cross. Did she not do her research? How difficult would it have been to find out? It makes me wonder about the rest of her facts. How sad.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Max Brooks has to be considered the ultimate modern-day writer when it comes to zombies. Between 'World War Z' and his 'Zombie Survival Guide' a zombie fan like myself is in flesh-eating heaven. 'Z' is a true masterpiece of the form though, and should be required reading for any horror/zombie fan. The research into geography, history, weapons and language are first-rate in this novel. Mr. Brooks has come up with so many new and terrifying scenarios that would undoubtedly play out in a zombie infestation that he leaves the reader feeling as if this were a work of non-fiction. A perfect piece of literature (zombie or otherwise).",,1

He also plagiarizes---basing his characters on other authors' creations, grabbing descriptions of famous entertainment personalities and libertines, etc. straight from the pages of biographies of them. This book is an insult to the city and people of Savannah, to the wonderful book written by Mr. John Berendt, and to anyone who makes the mistake of buying it, or even merely borrowing it from a library!

The problem in this story is that Lizzie won't take Booger trick -or- treating with her.

TONE_POLARITY,"If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in ""Arrested Development"". Watching this movie for ""Prinz"" and ""Stiles"" is counterproductive. Not only have the actors ""failed to make the best"" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences. Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming ""singer-songwriters"", and ""stop paying attention"" to their college plans. Much like the ""Friends"" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a ""time porn"" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides ""mature romantically"" and ""find themselves"". A movie for history's circular file.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I dont see why so many people are putting this movie down. I guess it is because they were expecting more gore then was actually in the movie, and that may be because the critics and previews made it seem that way. Dont get me wrong, this movie does have its bloody parts, but its not that bad and its not nonstop violence. Now for the positives i would definatly say this is very original plot and you'll never guess who the killer actually is at the very end. The story is very good and there's lots of suspense(i dont know how you could fall asleep watching it because it at least has a good story, even if it's not that gory). It is quite entertaining and demented, and James Wan(the director)did a good job on his first movie. See it and watch it with an open mind and dont put it down because its not that gory, because i've seen pleanty of gory movies that suck and thats because it didn't have a good plot(example:Candyman)Thank you and enjoy the movie!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I saw this at the drugstore for only $10 and thought I would give it a try. When I opened the the bulky plastic carrying case which is included with the item, the glass mirror which is attached to it fell off. Luckily it did not break. A cheap glue had been used to secure it. It included a personal groomer for ear and nose hair with an additional attachment for shaving other body hairs. But the personal groomer is so cheaply made that it cuts off if you move it quickly, and it barely cuts. The shaver itself is advertised as a ""pleasure of a gentle shave that leaves your skin amazingly smooth and soft to touch"". But you can run this thing all over your face all day and you will still have a five o'clock shadow. After using it a couple of times (why I tried it a second time I do not know), it is very apparent that this is, as another reviewer put it, a ""hunk of junk"".

I will add, however, that after seeing this as well as her earlier stuff,it's beyond painfully obvious that Breillat has an agenda and it doesn't include liking men. Her female character's sweeping statements about all men in general are insulting and unintelligent, and having a gay man speak for all men about how they view women is naturally, a bit skewed from the git-go. The sex isn't erotic in the least, and the shock value is so obviously there to shock, it just ends up as cinematic sludge.This is simply not an artistic film, but a dry and fairly pointless one.

In her efforts to be profound the author ignores any attempt at telling an interesting story.

TONE_POLARITY,"My only critism of this CD, is that it did not include the original version of 'Go away'. Then again, maybe that one should have been include on the 12"" CD release.

This is made up by the pull out bilingual sleeve and includes lyrics too! These songs are just as fresh today as they were in 1985. A testiment to the timelessness of the quality of Rose McDowall and Jill Bryson's superb musical skill and insights. Most would catagorize this ""PopGothic"", but it is more than just an inane label.

I've never been to Sturgis but I can really imagine what it must be like. The book begins in another realm but comes to earth and covers the country from east to west with gorgeous detail all the way. The characters are people I am sure I know!

TONE_POLARITY,"I was staying up late one night and happend to catch this movie late on the T.V.It starded off great, and looked like it was going to be really good. Then about 15 minutes(or somewere around that) the movie took a downward spiral toward being a cheap, and not as ambitious as it looked like it was going to be.First of all the acting was bad, and a movie like this one proves how important good acting is to a very much talked about subject matter like this one.2nd of all the movie is not that realistic. I realize the things that Ed Gein really did were far out, but this film just lacks an imortant realisitic aspect to it. For example. In one sceen Ed Gein shoots a female baretender, then while she is still alive, Ed drags her accross the floor and puts her into his truck, and takes her home. She kinda acts angery at Ed rather than fighting for her life.Bottom Line: If your want to no more about the subject, look elase where. If you must see it. Rent it. Don't spend to much on it.",,0

By that, I mean it's best enjoyed on a lazy, sunny afternoon or evening, when you're feeling chill and haven't a care in the world. By that merit, I love this album, but it really takes a lot of getting used to, more so than any other album I've owned. That is probably because this is easily the most unique album I've owned.

It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.I would not order these again.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"After 7's debut disc was released at time when almost every R&B record released was A-1.Two-thirds of the trio are the brothers of producer Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, and the other third is the cousin of Antonio ""L.A."" Reid; the two produced the majority of the album, which features three smash hits and a host of other likable tracks. The singles released were Heat Of The Moment, Can't Stop and Ready Or Not. Can't Stop & Heat Of The Moment were both up-tempo dance numbers while Ready Or Not is one of the best slow jams released in 1989. However the one song to me that makes the CD a classic is ""One Night,"" an urban adult contemporary composition that was never released; it showcases Melvin and Kevon in an impressive vocal exchange over a mid-tempo rhythm.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Nikon has put together this excellent kit especially for those who want to move up from the Point & Shoot digital to a reliable and easy to use SLR. The Nikon D40 is a basic model that provides quick shooting qualities using a standard short zoom auto focusing lenses. You'll automatically get great outdoor pictures and in-home short range pictures using the pop up flash. Unfortunately, you'll need a higher power attached flash to capture indoor pictures out beyond fifteen feet that the zoom lense will pull in. Learning the manual options will take a little time and effort and some knowledge of ISO ranges and lighting techniques are required. But for us amateurs the auto setting will do 9 times out of 10. The other draw back for us amateurs is that the Nikon D40 is limited to AF-S (self auto focus) lenses unless you want to manually focus each shot every time. Bottom line is this is an excellent buy for the money spent.",,1

The scenery is beautiful. I agree with one of the previous viewers, the theatrical trailer is cheesy. I guess the producers of this DVD could not locate the orginal 1955 trailer.

It's too long (cut out 100 pages or so in the paperback to reduce to around 150) for the point which he seems to have aimed to make. According to other reviewers here, its badly edited, which may explain the sense I felt that it was a little disjointed. The idea underlying the book is that those generally identified as being on the Left are motivated in large measure by a need to feel they have a morally pure insight into, and solution for, any problem faced by a society, a trait exposed by Hollander in ""Political Pilgrims"". The idea was a good one, the book didnt, to me, live up to its promise. The reader will get better value and a far more enjoyable read, from Hayek, von Mises, James Bovard or Hollander.",,0

Why some people are so closed emotionally ? Why it's so difficult to build relations or growing relations always got stuck at some point ? Why what happens outside is usually very different of what happens inside ? Why some of us tend to avoid any risk at all or are ready to put at stake everything without any wisdom applied ?

The accounts are all based on narratives written from the first arrival of Europeans until approximately The French and Indian War. It clarifies that Europeans and natives interacted in a vareity of ways and at different times were friendly or unfriendly towards each other. The French and English also brought their conflicts into the mix as the natives may have brought their conflicts too. A main concern is religion for the Europeans - The French want Catholic Indians and the English protestant ones. Alcohol was a drug easily promoted for trading purposes. When natives became hooked, the price went up. Captives with the natives were often viewed with suspicion and many English chose to live with the natives or with the French after awhile.

Like Clumsy, Unlikely is a collection of little episodes, slices of life. Brown has an unerring eye for the little inanities that make up real life... the tiny little moments that real relationships are made up of: when she looked at you from across the room the first time, when she went out to have a toke with your friends instead of staying to watch the end of the video with you, when she didn't pick up the phone because she was sleeping instead of showing up for your date... . There are no huge plot turns here, just the unrelenting incremental buildup and later crumbling of an unlikely love affair.

It can be a teadious read if you have read her other books. This is not as slow as ""feast of all saints"", but it does take a couple of chapters to pick up speed. If you are wanting a great read of Anne Rice's work the ""witching Hour"" Series is wonderful, as well as the vampire books she has published.

I tend to think it would be more worth a cheap seat viewing or rental price, but if you thought the previews looked good, see this film. I guess.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"If you've seen some of director Eric Stanze's more recent work like ICE FROM THE SUN or SCRAPBOOK, you might want to take a look at this fun, gory, low-budget flick.It's got a fairly complex storyline, decent acting, and above-average special make-up effects (considering the low-budget).Yeah, it's a little rough around the edges, but the moviemaker's enthusiasm for the project definitely helps push SAVAGE HARVEST beyond its budgetary restrictions.If you're a fan of indie horror, check it out!",,1

Beyond that, a film that has such depth and sadness, yet such perversity and humor that it evokes every emotion - if one is open to it.

Boy was I sorry I bought it.The DVD looks like it was mastered from an old film print, maybe even an old VHS tape due to some of the print damage that looks like video-tape ""snow"" rather than damage to an old film print. On top of that, it should be 85 minutes long, and is only a mere 72 minutes. The quality of the other film, THE MAN CALLED NOON, is no better. I'm used to cheap budget DVDs, but when parts of the movie are missing, I have to complain.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I read Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"" and now ""The Stowmarket Mystery,"" and I look forward to reading others by this author. Tracy should appeal to modern readers for his direct, generally unadorned style and quick-moving plots. Interestingly, despite a prose that is mostly utilitarian, you get a sometimes vivid sense of aspects of late Victorian England. If (for instance) you think that London streets were safer before the automobile was introduced, read this book.The investigator Brett is a lawyer, a professional in the mold of Freeman's Dr Thorndyke, who discovers clues and makes connections that others miss. His relationship with the police in the form of Inspector Winter is adversarial, but not without a certain amount of mutual respect (somewhat like the Furneaux/White relationship in Tracy's ""Number Seventeen"").Though I've only read 2 novels by Louis Tracy, I think he's held up better than other half-forgotten mystery writers of the period.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"In some ways an interesting plot, but overall I thought the acting was average at best. The movie is fairly dark and gruesome, though it does have somewhat of a redeeming message mixed in. Also some fairly explicit sex scenes (to the line of being what some would likely consider to be pornographic). If you're mainly looking for a movie with very graphic violence then I think you will probably enjoy this to some degree. If not, then I probably wouldn't waste your time.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I absolutely adore Ms Morrison's writing and books, so I was very excited when I finally ordered this and got it in the mail. I was never very familiar with the Tarot before I read this, and after reading this, I feel that I have a much greater grasp of it. Her writing style is to the point and friendly without being too aggressively-friendly, which makes it easy to follow and charming to read. Her meditations with each card are treasured, and the spells are varied and simple to use. She also gives personal stories about her experiences with the Tarot, which help the reader (especially the beginner) to relieve any fears or doubts that they might have. Although it isn't the ""most definitive"" text on the Tarot out there, it is certainly one not to be missed.",,1

Wait a bit, there's gonna be tons of these at your local used record store.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Therapists Harris and Milam seem to have their hands full dealing with cases of emotional abuse by legalistic, domineering Christian pastors, churches, or families. Speaking from long experience they share the dangers of an ""abusive"" version of Christianity, characterized by emphasis on conformity, authority, self-sacrifice, punishment, belief in an ultimate Armageddon, and ""emphasis upon the death of Christ over the life of Christ"".To deal with religion-related cases of emotional abuse, Harris and Milam attempt counseling with a spiritual dimension. Their therapy includes discussing other sides of the Bible's message, which call into question the authority of dominating individuals who claim to speak for God. It's a challenging and fascinating approach to a real mental health issue. And I think the authors tackle these issues with tough-minded compassion.--author of Correcting Jesus",,1

It also gives me compassion for my husband, and resources for support groups for me. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone feeling crazy in an interpersonal relationship, not able to understand the other person's behavior. It also helps you understand what borderline personality disorder is, since it's very complicated and each person has unique traits and different levels of each trait. What a relief to finally have some hope and some resources to help with the chaos.",,1

The story is SO absurd (WHERE the creatures came from had to be the lowest and most perverse idea S.K. had ever had); I hated every character (wanted them ALL to die after the first few chapters)and the story itself was plodding (it took the characters about a thousand pages to travel from Point A to Point B).This was a book written just to get something new on the shelves.I was very disappointed.

Explaining the spoofs would actually be funnier than the movie, so I won't do it.Tried and true spoof formula is not properly hashed out in cheap attempt to cash-in on quarter-of-a-century craze(Airplane 1980). Top Secret, Hot Shot, Hot Shot Part Deux and Not Another Teen Movie are much examples of this (art) form.Might have given it two stars if they left the Unrated off the box.A lot more of Josh Meyers might have helped.",,0

Priscilla Herdman's voice is better than most children's singers' because she avoids that goofy cute sound so many children's singers have. Her voice has the same clear, high quality that her fellow folksinger Judy Collins has.However, in all honesty, I have to say this album is pretty dull. We have it in our library, but the children don't check it out. I think, this is because the song selection doesn't appeal to them. The songs just aren't ""catchy."" A parent might be able to use this album to put a child to sleep. Whether this is because the songs are soothing, or merely boring is the question.",,0

But considering the almost constant use this remote is subjected to from a retired couple, I still think they are very good remotes for the price. The IR transmitter also when out on mine after 18 months of heavy use, but a call to Logitech support got me a new one in a few days at NO COST! NOT EVEN SHIPPING! And that was on a remote that was out of warranty! So, I don't understand the few reviews I've read claiming poor tech support; my experience has been anything but. I'd buy another in a heart beat!

However, I am not in a mood to be kind. U2 is a great band. Everything clicks with them. Nothing can change that and while the lyrics are still great, the songs are butchered. The singer does nothing but try and imitate Bono's wonderfully raspy voice and ends up sounding like a chainsaw. I can do a better job singing them in the shower. The music is loud and distracting. The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr and Adam Clayton, I imagine, would be horrified. A band that just started playing together a couple of weeks ago could do better. You get the idea. Given how dreadful it is, I am glad I borrowed a copy from a friend. I would highly recommend not throwing your money away on this. Go and buy the real deal, because nothing can compare.",,0

Raetz has also intricately woven the development of the characters as each story builds upon the previous stories, adding a glimpse into the lives of the WEB Agents outside the Bureau.""Shadows and Secrets"" is full of twists and turns with a bit of wit added into the mix.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The only thing I can add to the other really great comments about this game is this....If you have played other online games and been frustrated, this game is different. The first thing that you will notice, no running back for your corpse! If you choose to, you can go back and pray at your tombstone to get back a bit of experience point, but it is not required. There are no item lossed, when you die, you retain all items and money you had when you died, cool, I hated 'corpse runs' for my gear.Some have said that solo playing is hard, well, I solo play and it is not hard, just takes a bit longer.The tradeskills in this game are among the best I have seen. You can take up skills such as tailoring, armourcrafting, weaponsmithing, alchemy, and more.

Her latest, 'My Everything,' is just a testament to this lady's impeccable knack for wrapping herself around a song and delivering it in the Anita way, no matter how long it has been since she recorded. 'My Everything' is like having warm peach cobbler topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream when you've had nothing but tofu bars for the last eighteen months. It is decadent and filling, without being overly rich, all at the same time. The music industry has far too long been inflated with Beyonce and Ashanti derivatives; I am glad that Ms. Baker felt obliged to grace us once again with her voice. If you like good music, this album is a must buy!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The book I ordered never arrived. I checked tracking and DHL passed it off to USPS who delivered it somewhere on 12/28/07. The end result is ""Sorry Charlie""",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I thought this book was okay! It needed more suspense! But if you love Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson a lot you should read this book! The plot was faboulous! Great Book! Read it!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel so strongly that this one is awful, that I feel obligated to warn future buyers to keep your credit card in your purse when it comes to this one! I am an avid yoga/fitness DVD athlete -- have been doing yoga for over a decade, have run two marathons: I know my stuff.You could make a case for the yoga routine being a good one, but I find that the production is so awful that I can't hear the instructors voice, so I constantly have to bend out of positions just to look at the TV screen to see what she's talking about. Not to mention the camera shots of her tush and close ups of her inner thighs are just disgusting. She's very fit and toned, but I just don't want to see anyone up that close.If you want a yoga routine that makes you think you might be learning from a strip-dancer, go ahead and spend the 50+ bucks on this one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought the book because I was familiar with some of the people involved in the story. I also threw it away without finishing the book. It was poorly written, the story rambled, the author took many liberties in filling in his own version of details of people and events, and it seems like much of the facts were taken from court documents instead of interviewing the people involved.In short, don't waste your time.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I couldn't put this book down for one minute. I read it as I walked. In the end, I didn't even care who the killer was, it was the other characters that I wanted to read about. Hooper outdid herself with this one. All I can say is I can't wait until I can read more about Bishop and Randy and Bonnie. The love story was so intense, I never wanted it to end.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I've never bothered to write a review before, even with albums I really like. Although, this Big Star album has to be one of the best records I've ever heard....& I've heard quite a few! It is really incredible. Great songwriting, great guitar playing... a really fun, turn it up & have a good time record. It has some really good rocking tunes, & some mellow tunes, but they're ALL really, really, really good. Everyone should own a copy of this CD. That's it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I bought this item (Sony D-FJ041 CD Walkman portable CD Player with AM/FM Turner) because my original Sony finally stopped working after 8 years of no problem usaged.The first two times I used this new Sony player it worked ok the sound was a bit off but adequate. Then the third time I used it would not turn on at all I changed the betteries and put new ones in and nothing happened. It is piece of junk and past the 30 day point of no return.I don't understand why Amazon is carrying and selling such poor quality mechandise.I hope Amazon reads this and take it to heart.I'm not very young and not in turn with MP3 or IPOD players and I have nothing Portable to use to play all my CD's on when I go on walks.Would not reccomend this cd player to my worst enemy!!!Dissatisfied consumer.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This cd rocked. It cusses alot so I would get the edited version. My favorites are Nookie and N 2 gether now. They are 2 sweet songs. I would get this cd. If you liked the 1st cd, u will love this cd. Peace",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This book is just okay. The knight is not even mentioned in the story. And there ain't no princess either. Now come on, who writes a book with no princess or a knight if it is in the title? I believe that what is in the title should be included in the story. Maybe I am wrong. When I read Dr. Seuss books, if the book was The Cat and the Hat, there was a cat and a hat mentioned in the story. This story is just ""different."" Most of the books that I have read, mention the words that appear in the title. The books that don't, I usually don't enjoy. If you want to read a book like this, go ahead. I still enjoyed this book. But, nothing can compare to some of Cornelia Funke's other books, such as the Theif Lord.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The story is generally carried along by short conversations. but the voices do not change. I had to see who said or replied to know who was speaking. In good writing each character carries their own voice through the novel - that is how we get to know them. This does not happen here. The only interesting part is the knowledge about medicine herbs. I guess if one has never read a novel about Native Americans, either modernists or traditionalists, or better yet gotten to know a few, this might be a good start. But every culture carries its own language and thought patterns and to capture that is the trick of good writers. Hillerman of course comes to mind (as does Faulkner with an entirely different kind of ""unbeknown"" culture) - we know who each character is just by the way they phrase things.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I am also a fan of Becky Kelly and have bought the calendars in the past with the beautiful ribbons. I was disappointed when I got this year's calendar.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a very inspirational book for stumpwork enthusiasts. I have made many projects from this book, and use it as a cross reference when using other patterns, as Jane's techniques are often easier and give better results. Hopefully for most embroidery enthusiasts it won't prove too difficult to understand as her instructions are very clear and precise. She has alternative lists of materials at the back of the book if you can't find the threads she recommends, and one of the nice things about her books is that she encourages people to take the initiative to be bold and use materials you might find hidden in your sewing box at home.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Fun movie for the whole family - if a little predictable, the gorgeous scenery makes it well worthwhile. I grew up watching these films and still enjoy them.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is my 3rd 12C. (The first one got crushed, the second had a bad keyboard.) It's a workhorse financial calculator, the Platinum edition is faster and more powerful. It should last the rest of my life (I'm 68). Unconditional recommendation.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Although I never knew it by name, I was aware of the Gerson Therapy for many years and wouldshare what I remembered hearing about with anyone who would listen even though it was'nt untilI saw ""The Beautiful Truth"" that I finally got the whole story.The information enclosed in ""The Beautiful Truth"" can and should be life changing and makesperfect sense and confirms the adage ""You are what you eat.""Of course, changing a long developed lifestyle for the sake of one's health is'nt as easy as it soundsand long developed bad habits are'nt either. Rather, it should be construed as growing a plant froma single seed. The correct elements: water, sunlight, nutrition etc. will grow a full, healthy plant and product beautiful flowers and ripe delicious fruits.The DVD points out this scenario for the human body and provides enough legitimate informationfor the viewer to absorb and decide for themselves.I highly recommend it.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,Unbelievable- if it wasn't bad enough I've been listening to her CD nonstop now I'm watching the DVD nonstop too. How does an 11 year old sing with this level if interpretation and emotion? A true gift from God. I hope she and her family will be able to avoid the pitfalls of fame and the music industry and she remains at heart a normal child. I have 3 daughters and listening to her just moves me to no end ans makes me appreciate my daughters even more.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I don't like playing games much, but my son does -- he is only 7, but I bought him this Pirates version of Life because I didn't want a ""baby"" version like SpongeBob (from Amazon reviews). I wasn't disappointed. This is a very cool game and all his older cousins loved it! He loved it, too, once all the rules were established and somebody just has to read the cards for him. Everything is in Pirate dialect and the graphics are done nicely.I was pleasantly surprised to find that I can tolerate playing this game because it has some fun surprises and direction changes along the way.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This gripping story about mixed up teenage basketball star Jim Carroll shows Leonardo Dicaprio at his cinematic best.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this back in October. I had thought it would be like the others. First of all, this thing has no memory whatsoever. I had to buy a memory card just to do stuff. Second, it doesn't have built in wifi so I can't go on the Internet without it saying 'Memory to low, click a task to terminate'. I wish that ipaq's would come with more games than just Solitaire and Jawbreaker. If this is priced at more than 50 bucks, don't buy it. I bought mine on ebay for $155, and now I'm just pissed!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"OK, I don't know why I love this movie so much but it touches me every time I watch it. It is the only movie I have ever actually purchased. Maybe because Georges is so uncool and so loveable I just want him to get the beautiful girl. This is really a ""feel good"" movie.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,For the amount that these cost over regular wiper blades I was expecting something amazing. At first they worked quite well but the quality of the wipe deteriorated quickly. After carefully cleaning them using rubbing alcohol they start to work better but it doesn't last long.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this after going thru my 2nd Nite Rider set (bad wiring). It is plenty good for both seeing and being seen, as a matter of fact, it is a lot brighter than the $160 Nite Rider I replaced. I bike along an unlit 10' wide path that is oftentimes littered with fallen tree limbs, etc. It is great on even the darkest and rainiest rides. Battery life so far real good, I've used it for 5 hours so far, and it uses 4 AA's, so I will replace the alkaline AA's provided with it with 2600 MA NiMH rechargeables.

Granted, the singing is quite good, but I've heard better portrayals of all the roles on other sets. I'm a huge Sutherland fan, and on this set I even found her lacking. I suspect I'll be lambasted for my heretical views, but I just don't think this is the greatest recording of Don Giovanni I've heard.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"My first read of Mariah Stewart's novels, Until dark held me in suspense throughout the book, page by page. From beginning til end, I had a suspicion who the 'baddie' was, but getting t the end was a wonderful experience.For those of you who hate the idea of reading a romance novel... take heed. I didn't realize this was classified as a romantic suspense until I was within 50 pages of the end when a co-worker pointed it out to me. As good as any of the main-stream suspense writers out there in my opinion. A great read!!!",,1

I anticipated receiving the disc in the original packaging (along with the cover)as though it were purchased brand new from a store. The disc itself was in fine condition. However, it came in a clear plastic case. I don't think the cd should have been advertised as being in ""like new condition."" The music by Coldplay is great and the disc is definitely worth purchasing, particularly if you like all of their other cd's but don't own this one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I have been riding for over 40 years. As most of us I have gotten lazy about the basics. This is a great book not only for a new rider but even the more experienced one.the short chapters and the antidotes point out that riding bikes is both fun and dangerous at the same time. It expands on the MSF guide book and would be a great addition to any one's library.Ed,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Warcraft, then you should love this one. The main reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that the game only stores stats and progress for a single player (ie. someone else can't start their own campaign without erasing yours), plus the game isn't terribly difficult or long to beat- although it has tons of variety, multiplayer maps, and characters to play as.",,1

I would pick a different option, since this only lasted a few days.

TONE_POLARITY,"Hero--tortured, yes. Beast, No--and for that, I was very disappointed. I guess ""beast"" was what the townspeople thought of this unknown, unseen ""dragon"". The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea.",,0

Best of all, the plugs rotate to the side eliminating the ""bulge"" you usually have with six plugs and transformers.

Compared to those, the 4100 doesn't show much of a difference, except for high treble notes, which seem to be cut off, but hardly noticeable. These work best on a 4.1 channel sound card and above, on a 2.1 the left and right surround speakers are very weak and use the same channels as the left and right front. This can only be heard when the surround speakers are placed close to the ear. Overall, excellent fidelity and ambience, impressive bass, and true surround accompany this system, which is one, if not the, best in it's price range. Keep up the good work CA!",,1

John Doe 2 an Iraqi, built the bomb in an old white truck (later transferred to a Ryder) with the help of an Islamic Jihad terrorists cell from the Middle East and concealed by local jihad in OKC. Killing children was the plan for John Doe 2. His hatred was uncontrolable. I was a witness to the events surrounding the bombing.

TONE_POLARITY,After reading the reviews I thought this would be a nice toy for my miniature dachshund who loves any plush toy that squeaks. She was very excited when I pulled it out of the box and squeaked it but once I gave it to her she had a really hard time getting her mouth around it and squeaking it herself. She picks it up once in a while but I can tell its not one of her favorites because it takes too much effort for her small mouth to squeak it. Probably better for a medium size dog.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is a greatest hits collection, spread over two CDs, including hits from GM's Wham! days. It's great for listening when reading, or reflecting back on the days when we all had mousse or gel in our spiky hair.

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm rather a fan of Turtledove's work, but this one left me mostly annoyed. The conceit is amusing, but the meticulous attention to detail that Turtledove uses so well in his alternate histories serves him poorly here. The inside jokes about LA, in particular the San Fernando Valley, are fun; and the mechanics of the world are well thought out -- but the result is somehow tedious; I found myself turning pages to get the punch line, rather than savoring each page as I did with (for example) his Civil War books.I'm disappointed. It sure won't stop me from scooping up other Turtledove books, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone either.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,This little book takes about 40 minutes to read. It is not what you might expect. It is not a minute by minute account of what happened during the bombing.

He is pushing his obvious agenda on his readers. Funny, for a guy who has no agenda, he fails to mention any concerns at all about industrial pollution doing anything to the environment. Evidently it is only environmentalist and ecoterrorists who do damage to the environment. He even manages to toss in that silcone breast implants don't cause cancer, so keep sticking those fake boobs in girls. Crichton likes them. I used to like his novels, but this book reads like he is desperate to get back on top, so politically fanatic he couldn't control himself or vying for a lucrative paying job at Fox News.",,0

I am fine without them having batteries or making noise, but it is irritating that they can't even be pressed. My daughter got frustrated pretty quick with that. (2) The little wallet is hard for kid fingers to open, so it is pretty much worthless.

The guy offers to drive him to the college and Clark finally agrees after some time. When they reach their destination,Clark gets out and goes to the trunk to wait for the guy to open it...as soon as Clark is around,the guy drives away with all the stuff in the trunk. A while after he sees that same guy walking down the street and he chases,catches,and tells him to give his stuff back. The guy didn't have his money but MOST of his clothing. The guy told Clark that he could give him a job paying $500 a trip. That's where Clark gets himself into trouble,not realizing what he was doing. This is a funny and cute movie. I would recommend this if you are bored and looking to watch a movie that'll relax you.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"it's very safe to say that Cranes are a unique band. the music is simple and sometimes very stark with minimal elements that add a touch of fragile beauty. their unique appeal is only strengthened by the vocals, which at times, sound like a frightened child. Cranes have created a musical landscape that borrows from the composer Satie, Cocteau Twins, and maybe even a little bit of Velvet Underground. but they have twisted all these elements into a form and shape that is all their own. a challenging listen that is worth investigation.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Well, as much as I dislike Katie Holmes and her squeaky voice, I got this to fill the girlie movie requirement of a rental night marathon. Forest Whitaker does have a touch with female-skewed movies. The movie was rather cute, actually. Although I wish Katie's ribs weren't showing while she was wearing the blue bikini in the beginning - why oh why can't actresses these days have a little meat on them? - she played the role with charm. And there was certainly good chemistry between her and Marc Blucas (who I had no complaints about on viewing him sans sweatshirt). The whole thing had feel of a modern fairy tale - which was obviously intended and not a bad thing. Feel-good, enjoyable escapist fare. And we all need a getaway sometimes.",,1

Difficult little instruments to master (I'm still working on it). Since they are so inexpensive, try one of each and see if you like the sound of one more than the other. Then, if you find yourself researching further you will have an idea of what the various name brands represent. Or, check with a music master before buying. That certainly isn't me. Otherwise, just buy the Walton and enjoy it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I have avidly pursued numerous VU albums. In addition to owning all of their released material, I have acquired bootlegs and unreleased tracks. This album was a trumendous diappointment. The Velvet Underground lost their magic after breaking up following the release of Loaded. All members of the band have remained talented. But together again after so many years, this Velvet Underground's recording is a painful experience, a harsh reminder of a vibrance that once existed and is no longer there. My advice is to stick with the original recordings or old live ones.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,Its a captivating story that holds interest for both those that find joy in time piece movies and shows and those who want a romance story.

TONE_POLARITY,"I've bought aftershock after I've got the first two books:last wish & earthquake. This book exemplifies the struggle of all characters as they face a disaster that will change their lives forever. I find the book heartwarming because the characters takes a look back on the past-the love,friendships and their trials. This shows the strong bond between the Wakefield twins-Jessica & Elizabeth and their love for their family and friends. I highly recommend this book to the other readers not only for entertainment purpose but also for a guide through teenage life as well.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series. I highly recommend the first two books.",,0

You literally dont realize that they are there. The headphones are very light, and very adjustable. Some people consider the plastic constructions a negative feature, but honestly i throw them on my desk, I abuse them and they just ask for more.

I *KNOW* that there have to be better singers' voices that could have been used.

TONE_POLARITY,"My advice to you is to not get this game whatsoever. First of all they have these trivia questons that are from the most remote movies ever. Then before you can do ANYTHING you have to pick up other peoples trash (Which is just a dumb idea) Then when you do have the money from picking up trash you try to go on a ride and Woody the Woodpecker say ""This ride is full"" Then you have to go back to the front of the park (I wish you luck doing this)and use the points you got from shaking peoples hands and get a hat. (Another dumb idea) By the way when you try to get back to the ride (again i wish you luck) you cant find it. There is no map or signs of any sort. And the camera angles are horrible. This game is probably the worst game I've ever played in my whole life. I have Gamecube, XBOX, PS2, Dreamcast, N64, and Super Nintendo. And by far the easiest game.

Densely packed verses and simple, snappy drum beats make this an album which lives up to its sci-fi namecheck.

TONE_POLARITY,"Bottom line is this is an album that should not have been released to the public yet. The recordings are also very bare which would be okay if this was ""Let it Be: Naked"" but it's not even close. So the songs which are already bad, suffer from simplistic intstrumentation. There isn't one song on here that's gonna grab you and hit you in the chest and make you say, ""I'm so glad I got this CD"". Look I love Ryan Adams and I'm a song-writer/singer myself and I think he's one of the best song-writers ever, but these songs are so forgettable. There is nothing to remember about it.

TONE_POLARITY,"It is my opinion that this book presents an overly optimistic view of contract technical writing. First of all, contract tech writing is limited to certain geographic areas. If you live in a nice, quiet little burg, you will have a hard time locating work. In other words, be prepared to move to the big city to find work. Telecommuting is not a reality for most of us. Maybe in the future, but not now! Second of all, everyone and their uncle is trying to get into the profession. Kent fails to mention that a technical ""knowledge base"" is necessary in order to convince those who have the power to hire you. Just having an English degree won't get you in the door. Thirdly, much of the material is just a rehash from the earlier edition.Buy the book if you must, but keep your reality reading glasses close at hand.Roger Peterson",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"In a book aiming to thresh out the dynamics of gender, Lorber's text seems to demonstrate that she doesn't have exactly the firm grip of the subject that the title suggests she has. While the other chapters which deal with more feminist issues with relation to gender are a bit more sound and solid, and the preceding chapters dealing with the 'nuts and bolts' of gender are somewhat vaguely fresh and readable (although not really saying much new), it is worrisome to see that while Lorber tries her hardest to remain objective, her dated and misunderstood views on transgender (she does not use this already popular term) issues betray her objectivity. All in all, her little inconsistencies and sometimes erroneous reasoning to gender, especially with regard to gender identity, do really show that she might have missed the boat with this one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Adele Morales (who insists on keeping her famous ex husband's name- she is one of several wives) took the plunge into exploiting her husband's name and tremendous literary reputation with the apparent hope/expectation that by revealing the details of their marital years, she would also profit. She has no journalistic saavy, apparently limited intelligence as she fails to deliver the gory scoop that the jacket promises. Instead she indulges in extolling her own deluded and narcissistic virtues (as she perceives them) and guys, it's tiresome. Her way of putting words together and general idea conveyance leaves much to be desired, which strikes me with wry irony because the level of Norman Mailer's genius renders his taste in this woman laughable. Sadly, at the climax of her ""epic torture"" I found myself commiserating with her husband- after all, he had to put up with her for too long.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This is my review on Katie.com by Katherine Tarbox. 13-year-old Katherine Tarbox meets 23-year-old Mark on the internet. Katie thinks that Mark is an excellent swimmer, good student in school, good-looking, etc. But one night mark called Katie and convinces her that he should go to her swim meet.I really liked this book. It taught me about all the dangers that we have on the internet. So if you ever meet somebody you don't know on the internet just use one of your BLOCK icons and he or she can't bug you any more. I think kids who are 12 and older should read this bookThank you for reading my review. I hoped you enjoyed it. So read this book today. I gave this book 4 stars ****.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The idea of this blanket is great; however, like another person said, it does not swaddle the baby nearly tight enough- my son would have his arms and legs out in less than a minute. He is a big baby but the newborn size was too large. We waited, hoping that when he grew, it would work better. Now he is over 12lbs and the tabs still go way past where they are supossed to attach, and he's outgrown the length. Save your money and buy some waffle weave blankets- they stretch and work much better- I was even able to swaddle my 9m old son in them {I had to swaddle him for a long time}.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Each song in this album is all great. Not even one song is bad. This is the highest quality album I've ever listened to. Billy Corgan is so creative. He showed in this album all the kind of things he can do. What this album is missing is songs doesn't support each other as one. There are loud rock music and soft ballard, and fast pop music all in one cd! In Adore, Billy Corgan did it right, but not as high quality as this album. I give 5 stars because what he did is unbelievable, despite of all I've said.",,1

The plastic on each of the pages in these albums is all wrinkled instead of smooth like in our other albums. Also, once you have put 300 pictures in the album, the cover would not lay flat anymore like our others. Unfortunately I even bought 2 of these. I definitely would not buy them again.

I thought it was a terrfic and entertaining movie and Tom Hanks was fantastic playing an immigrant from a foreign country that no longer existed for him, but he's done much better work in much better movies, yet, I can't fault him on this one because he was funny, intriguing and very cool in the role. I thought he did a great job, the accent must have been tough for him, but he was good. Just damned good. The great supporting cast certainly helped, but if I were asked to recommend this movie to someone, I certainly would. If nothing else, it's entertaining and Tom did a pretty good job. And overall, it was an interesting story.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"...the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life.I was a great fan of Michael Ball's when his career was focused on the musical stage, but his move (and subsequent albums) to the pop arena left me cold. As well as being a fan of musical theater, I also adore country music. So, when I found out that Michael Ball had made a ""country"" album, my curiosity was piqued.First of all, this is not country music. These are covers of songs originally recorded by country artists. This CD would not be considered country in Nashville, Minneapolis, Branson or even Vegas. The last, however, seems the most likely home for this CD. Gone is the simple and clear emotional renderings of the original artists. Instead, the sorry souls listening are subjected to over-orchestrated arrangements created, to my best guess, to hide the fact that Mr. Ball's once incredible range has all but disappeared and years of smoking and vocal misuse have wreaked havoc on his vocal chords.",,0

I re-read the first three to refresh my memory with the comings and goings of our friends Chole and Cheftu. Imagine my disappointment to have to say how much I hated this book. There was almost no interaction between Chole and Cheftu, no clear explanation of how we got there or where we are going, and a really dumb story line. Ms. Frank also forgot to continue with some outstanding issues from the prior novels....like with the character Dion and a certain elixir?

TONE_POLARITY,These headphones have a lot of base. This makes the music seem louder than it is and it is a lot fuller and more immersing. They don't have an active noise canceling system but do a good job passively.The sound quality on these if you like bass is the best you can get for your money. If you're not a bass fan there are some better options out there. That being said the base does make the music sound better (i think) in genres other than Rap. At the $30 price I got these for I would recommend buying them even if your not a bass fan. They are comfortable and feel like a well made product. An enormous step up from my ipod brand earbuds.,,1

From S.C.I.E.N.C.E. to Make Yourself to Morning View, they slowly progressed to tighter more produced music, losing some of their heaviness in the process. Apparently, somebody decided that this needed to be changed. Someone also apparently locked the produced in the closet, as this entire album sounds like it was recorded in a basement. The songs are much heavier that the previous 2 albums, so if you were a big S.C.I.E.N.C.E fan, you might enjoy that, but it feels like much of the artistry is gone, and all attempt at any backup vocals/harmonies seems to have gone out the window.",,0

The fact is, though, to understand the Idea or Essence in any system of thought, we must go to the doctors or epitomes of that creed. The proper study of this dualism, and its relation (anti-relation) to Christianity is to be found in, e.g., Manichaeism, Buddhism, Catharism. Dried-up popular and superficial creeds don't have the life in them that these more excellent (and demanding faiths) do. The proof is plain; each of these aforementioned movements has its Saints. Where, I might (unfairly) ask, are the martyrs, the living perfections of the New Age movement? One actually has to stifle his laughter; it (Gnosticism) will fade again, and return again; no matter.

I am thrilled with this series, and had sought long and hard for a single-series history resource for homeschooling my children-- I did not want to take a literature approach where you read dozens of different books. I also wanted a course that was more or less secular. While Bauer's books are certainly in the ""western tradition,"" they are not explicitly religious per se.

TONE_POLARITY,"Since 1982 I have been a fan of Duran Duran & their music. And with their latest ""Pop Trash"", must admit, on the first listen, my expectations had not been met to their fullest. HOWEVER, by the 3rd listen, I was hooked! Every song on this album is worthy of listening to. ""Playing w/Uranium"", & ""Something To Remember"" are excellent. Do think they could've had a few more up-tempo songs on this CD, however, not bad for some ""80's has-beens"" (as most of their critics like to refer to them by), but Duran Duran is very much alive! Their live shows only prove how withstanding their music really is...""Pop Trash"" is certainly not trash; if you give it more than a listen or two, chances are, it will grow on you.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I read this book several years ago, and I was very pleased with how pleased my man was after I tried several of the tips in the book. I lent the book to a friend and never got it back, so I bought it again recently to review, and again, my man is quite happy with the new things I've learned to do from this book. It's also a lot of fun at a bachelorette party, or any party where it's ""just the girls"", so that the information can be shared, and so that others can be encouraged to tell their fun stories.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Our family loves Curious George, but this book is absolutely horrible. It is a relic from an earlier world. The man captures George, puts him in a sack and takes him off to put him in a zoo. George smokes, as do a lot of other people in the book. Try to explain to a 2 or 3 year old why George is having a nice smoke before bed. Or try to explain why the man has captured George, stuffed him in a sack and taken him to live in a zoo. Other Curious George books are really great - we love the ones where he gets a bike, goes to the beach, goes to a Halloween party and goes to the pizzaria. However, the only way we can look at this one is after I cut out a lot of the pages.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,I treat myself on vacation by going to the salon and spa. I asked my high-priced Vegas stylist what I can buy when I get home that won't break the bank. She recommended Biolage by Matrix. I find that not only does my color last longer but the shampoo does as well! You don't need much to work up a good lather. I also purchasedBiolage by Matrix Color Care Conditioner 33.8 Ounceswhich is also perfect.I will be buying this again - that is when it finally runs out!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"If you are looking for 14 GA wire because you intend to have long runs or put a good bit of power through it, this is definitely not the speaker wire you want to buy. The wire and the protective jacket combined are about 14 GA, which means each of them is ridiculously thin. The jacket offers little protection, and the strands are so thin that they look like they would break easily.I was foolish and ignored the other reviews, because I thought even 16 GA would be alright. Many people get thicker wire than they need anyway. But I wouldn't use this wire except on something like a Home Theater in a Box, or something similar with little power, short runs, and/or low expectations on sound quality. If you are thinking to buy this because it's a good deal, then compare it to other 100' spools of 18 Gauge speaker wire. Even then, consider that this likely has a thinner jacket than most other 18 GA wires you find, and you would probably be better off to go with something else.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Decent submissions from Tom Drury, Jeffrey Eugenides, Melanie Rae Thon and Jonathan Franzen, but overall the choices don't really smack of greatness. Plus, many of the entries feel too much like bits of novels yanked out of the overall context of the novel itself, so that in a vacuum, they pretty much whither away. There's also some fairly glaring omissions here (no David Foster Wallace or Richard Powers? What planet are these people from???), but I guess beauty's in the eye. Or whatever",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The deepest feeling I come away with is a ""You were there"" sort of idea. Details are vivid - my favorite is the depiction of the first Right to Life march in D.C., when police went to arrest some of the protestors, who happened to be Pentecostals who suddenly felt the Spirit, began speaking in tongues and rolling on the ground. The police retreated, briefly.Of course, given such vivid ""you were there"" detail, one has to question how much of this account is mere perspective, how much is fact. As such, it is a useful, though not central, work in studying the pro-life movement, and certainly not a theological or sociological treatise. The book accomplishes what it intends to do, which is to describe the development of the pro-life movement in very human terms. For that it earns 4 stars.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Michael graves has indeed high expectations to measure up to, but he does indeed accomplish that and lends the matured melodic Horror-Punk sound of this album his brilliant and charismatic vocals. Still they keep to their unique characteristics and although Famous Monsters has shifted even more into the Punk-Rock corner, they still have their cutting edge and allow you to enter a gloomy B-movie world while listening to the songs. This album is clearly proof that the Misfits were and are much more than just relying on Danzig's great vocals.",,1

But by far the most frustrating aspect of these bottles are the impossible-to-read labels found on the underside of the nipple. My twins alternate between level 1 (for breastmilk), Level 2 (for formula), and the Y cut (for formula thickened with cereal). It is ridiculously difficult to read the transparent raised label on the underside of the nipple, especially when it is a bleary-eyed attempt in the middle of the night.If I didn't get these for free from a friend, I never would have stuck with the brand.",,0

Laura Fraser's ""Italian Affair"" is nothing special, and very uninteresting. Now Fraser's book rests in my Trash can on its way to the city dump. It is a boring story of a middle age woman who travel thorugh Italy alone. We all have similar experiences in Italy, but not all of us will be so available nor insensitive enough to write about these boring encounters. I know I will not read anything written by Laura Fraser ever again in the future. At least I gained this knowledge.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I recommend CAMEL to everyone. Why is this band so forgotten? Andrew Latimer should be up there with Jeff Beck and Clapton etc...The song choices on this compilation are good, but not great. CAMEL has so much more to offer the listener than some of these questionable pieces selected for this disc.I own this collection. But the real heart of this band lies with either ""THE SNOW GOOSE"" or ""NUDE"". These both are classic, classic, classic prog albums that will melt your brain and then put things in perspective for you.All in all, CAMEL is superb. If you don't want to buy individual albums, buy this. If you're ready to start a relationship with this animal, start with ""THE SNOW GOOSE"".",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I read over a hundred pages of this book, only to chuck it in the library return pile. For most of the first half of the story, the protagonist just runs around using her new-found powers in silly ways. She doesn't seem to suffer any ill effects from this. She doesn't grow as a person. She doesn't change. And it isn't even all that amusing.The story hints at depth--Gyp's abusive mother; the disparity between the magical and non-magical in a marriage; life-threatening illness; a power of curses--but none of it ever seems to pan out. The story offers an ocean of possibility, and we're stuck in the wading pool with little kiddie water-wings.I'm just annoyed I wasted the time I did.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm getting sick of remixes nowadays, what with their philosophy of ""we'll make a good trance song, then throw in a few samples of the original track at the last minute"". When a song has vocals this good (and few do), why in God's name would you strip them out and just loop one line?! Of all five tracks, only two have more than one verse included, and only one remains faithful to the feeling of the original. This track, the last one, is actually a very cool remix and the only thing saving this disc from complete failure. Oh yeah, whatever happened to including the album mix on singles as well? Is it just an evil sceme to get us to buy the GAWD-AWEFUL domsestic release of ""Movement in Still Life"", rather than paying a few dollars more for the far, far, FAR superior double disc import?

After the first few minutes, the only reason I continued to watch this was because my boyfriend was watching it and there wasn't anything better to do. It's awful. I don't get why people think this is a good movie or even comparable to the exorcist. It's slow moving and just plain BAD.

Mr. Vidal is so full of himself, so self-conscious of his sentences, that its impossible to focus on the story. He's always smirking and trying to show why he's smarter than someone else. It might be better if he picked up some of the classics and learned a lesson or two. Is he iconoclastic? No, just close minded.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The late 1960s were a time of raw innovation, cultural blendings, genre bendings, and what-the-hell experiments. In A=MH2, Mick Hutchinson took the blues guitar stylings of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Fleetwood Mac, Chicken Shack and The Groundhogs and blended them with the trance-inducing rhythmic pulse of Indian music. Ragas for blues guitar, in a word.The results were not entirely successful, but nonetheless proved highly influential. Guitarists as diverse as Peter Green, John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock have cited this LP as a major influence, and Mick's talents were equal to any of them. Filled out by the saxes, keyboards and drums of Andy Clark, this album is an amazing historical document of a time when artists were free to try anything.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I like the album, but that's because I'm a softy. The production is still as spotless as it was on their debut; musically, they've fallen into the same pop/rock Venus fly trap that ensnares all but the best modern groups. ""Ten Days Late"" is fun (""Funny how you always cried out daddy,"" he says!) and there's a good line in ""Camouflage"" (""We walk along like a sequel/You're a cameo""), but it just isn't really good, particularly in comparison with their debut, which I thought was a knockout.

TONE_POLARITY,"While this movie is titled Journey to the Center of the Earth, you'd never know that it was based on Jules Verne's book of that title. It's a slow, boring journey to the center of something, with a few birds and a plesiosaur - no dinosaurs - and a few hairy people. By the time the cast meets the natives, the movie becomes more like a bad remake of Heart of Darkness, with a grizzled explorer ruling over the natives. Only that ends pretty quickly. On top of this, the acting is lousy and a teenage boy provides utterly useless narration (as if we needed him to tell us when a guy and girl are flirting). The only positive thing I can say is that the special effects weren't half bad for a made-for-TV movie. Overall, avoid at all costs.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The Cosmic Rape (""To Marry Medusa"" is the short story from which it was expanded) tells the story of a wandering space conquerer who is shocked to discover that humans, unlike any other race it had ever known, did not have a group mind. Convinced that this is how it's meant to be, Medusa enlists the help of a born loser to put all the brainwaves back together again.The Cosmic Rape is one of these utopia vision sci-fi novels that seemed to populate the late 50s/early 60s. Sturgeon is a fine writer, and his recognizable style makes it immediately much more than the sum of its parts. The characters are grubbily and wonderfully real, even if the plot can't always say the same for itself.Recommended for fans of science fiction writing of the period, and for fans of Sturgeon.",,1

He responds with a series of hilarious non sequiturs and light-headed nitwit-isms, even when conversing with the locquacious and flowery characters of Lovecraft's most overwrought dialogue.The humor of these three tales is all in the contrast between the styles of the two masters, who must have been contemporaries of a sort, but who hailed from such different worlds. Peter Cannon takes this running joke about as far as it can go, borrowing liberally from the plots of several of HPL's most famous chillers, while Bertie supplies all the jokes from soup to nuts.",,1

Its scary to think the government could actually cover-up anything like this, but if you remember the news conferences the government gave they changed their story at least four times. For example, the military confirmed there were missile tests in the area then this story was changed to avoid criticism. Also, there were around 200 witnesses that saw a streaking light going towards the plane before it exploded. The government gave many reasons for this, with the best being electrical currents from power lines, and even tried to discredit all the witnesses. Sanders talks about this and many other examples that readers will find both fascinating and scary at the same time.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This unit works great--I have no complaints. Here's what the experience of buying this unit has taught me:1) Spend the extra few $$ for the 7-port unit. I first was going to buy the 4-port version, but decided that the larger unit was probably a good bet. After I hooked it up, USB devices seemed to come out of the woodwork.2) I put the unit on my desktime, tucked behind my monitor. I've found that it's much more convenient to plug and unplug USB devices when the USB ports are near at hand. Even the two ports on the front of my DellDimension are less convenient, since the computer box is a few feet away.3) If you plug any USB 1.1 devices into this unit, all ports will work at the USB 1.1 speed. You'll lose the USB 2.0 speed advantage on the other ports. All of my devices are now USB 2.0, so this isn't an issue for me. If you have older 1.1 devices, this may be a real pain, though.",,1

In this case, it works the other way round.

The other reviewers keep saying that D is mumbling and that the songs are too long. This is true... in addition to the fact that some songs are oh-so repetitive and the instruments could've been MUCH louder (check out the keyboard line on ""Feel Like Making Love""). And the cussing/rap verses... don't get me started. But what I did like about this album... is that he's D'Angelo. The person who kicked off the whole neo-soul genre. What I did like about this album is that D is in a league of his own. He's the guy that you compare every new jack to nowadays. Where do you think Musiq Soulchild got his style from. Exactly.

All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around.

Other than everybodys better (which has radio written all over it) and ways to suday (which is blues driven) I really dont think this cd has much flair or personality.

Let's not kid ourselves, there is only one Frisell and Monder.The band seems lost half the time, but that's to be expected when you have somebody who don't know what they want to do as a leader.If you want to hear ambient jazz guitar music played right pick up some Bill Frisell, Ben Monder, John Abercrombie, Terje Rypdal, Steve Tibbetts, and David Torn.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Saw Clapton interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on 11/08. Clapton told the interviewer that, as much as he regrets to admit, he just can't do some of those things he used to be able to do on the guitar. More and more, Clapton is truly becoming ""Slowhand."" For the past several of his albums, that really bothered me. He seemed not only to be slowing down (hey, the man's in his sixties) but he also seemed to be writing songs just to fill up space. But, here, on this CD with his friend J. J. Cale as his musical mentor, Clapton's guitar work is stellar. Here, the ""Slowhand"" appelation is certainly appropriate, but there's a feeling here that Clapton has also found a new interest in his own playing. The songs are mostly Cale's and they're great stuff, but what's nice is how fresh and energized and interested Clapton sounds. By the way, have you seen the DVD of Clapton's Crossroad's Guitar Festival; it'll blow you away.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Artemis Fowl is a brilliantly written book, that delves into an imaginary world like no other.Twelve-year-old genius Artemis Fowl, son of a missing criminal, discovers the secret elve world below the Earth's surface and also their large hoard of gold.Fowl devises what seems like a fool-proof plan, what with the help of his larger-than-life assistant and his incredible mind.But he doesn't count on the interference of one Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon Unit, an elvish police outfit responsible for making sure humans never find out about their world.Short soon gets her hands messy in attempting to stop Fowl, and the ending is very exciting!Artemis Fowl is a great read for young people who enjoyed the Alex Rider Series by Anthony Horowitz, or the original 007 novels by Ian Fleming.I highly recommend this book, and the sequel, Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,Oh my god this was just pathetic. It was funny as all heck but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. This movie was terrible. Lucy Lu is not a good action figure. She was stiff and slow. She wasn't good in Charlie's Angels so it proves that Lu's friend Banderas helped her land this role.This movie was retarded and dumb. Banderas' acting ( or should I say STRUGGLING with words ) was numbing and he was wasted. His character ( as dumb as it was ) slowly diminished into a pod without a brain. Lu hogged up the screen with another one of her wooden performances. All she does is stare blank eyed at the camera. The special effects were old-fashioned. T2 did things like this in 91!Ballistic is just another big movie full of noise and bad acting. For their sakes Lu and Banderas better pray for a hit movie because Ballistic has sealed their careers' fate.,,0

The pedantic ""facts about Alaska"" would also probably be better tolerated by a young reader, accustomed to the style from school books.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book collects about three dozen Chuck Klosterman essays, mostly reprints from SPIN and other US magazines, with new introductions from the author. The first and strongest half of the book ""Things That Are True"" centers on music and includes profiles of modern greats Radiohead and Jeff Tweedy as well as classic legends like Robert Plant and Billy Joel. He documents a week of eating nothing but McDonalds' McNuggets (eight years before the film ""Supersize Me"") and watching 24 hours of VH1 Classic (and learning it repeats every eight hours). The next 100 pages are ""Things That Might Be True"" and feature more subjective content. The final section is a 35 page novella.

And each time I return to re-reading it, I still can't put it down!Astrid's cruel, poetic mother, Ingrid, is sentenced to prison after killing her ex-boyfriend who left her for another woman. You're taken through Astrid's experiences at many foster homes. As she grows older, she learns more about herself as well as her mother, sexuality, religion, art, men, love, and the people around her, as well as her own past.I love the way the story is written, the language is rich and poetic. The characters feel like real people. When I'm reading the book, I often have to remind myself that it's not a real story, because it seems so real!My review doesn't even give this book justice.

If you're feeling cynical, or doubt that one man can make a difference in society, read this book. Muzikowski chronicles his life from a tough childhood to a self-destructive early adulthood through his current and permanent persona, a caring, compassionate person who genuinely wishes to spread goodwill. Hopefully, this story will inspire others to follow in Bob's footsteps, and love their neighbors. The narrative is alternately heartbreaking, hopeful, and humorous, but always honest. A seemingly endless parade of intriguing supporting ""characters"" add color depth to Muzikowski's infectiously interesting vignettes.

TONE_POLARITY,"Curious Steampunk foray, based on the wonderful premise that Charles Babbage's mechanical computer actually achieved practicality. As a consequence, the information age arrives concurrently with the industrial revolution. The plot consists of three vignettes that track the chain of custody of a case of valuable computer punch cards. The middle narrative dominates, and it's central character, Thomas Mallory, is the only character that achieves any depth, though Lawrence Oliphant is an intriguing historical figure. The story, it turns out, is narrated by Difference Engine itself, iterating the story of how it came to achieve self-consciousness. I liked the 19th century slang and historical detail. The alternative history touches require some knowledge of 19th century history and people; most are quite subtle and amusing. Not much by way of emotional payoff, though.

His rendition of Gollum is amusing, light, and lively. His rendition of some of his other poetry (for example The Mewlips and The Hoard) is worth listening to more than the poems are worth reading.This is essential to the collection of any Tolkein fan.

I thought the book could have expanded more on Clustering and Partitioning. I found errors in the Chapter tests and other areas, so watch out. A lot of information was covered in 70-431 that is in this book. Don't get hung up on the repeat of information because you are taking all this information and taking a test over ""Case Studies"". The test will show you a company situation and then you must solve a problem. It is not just a ""fact test"" -- like ""What is the Workgroup edition memory limit?"" or something like that. There are a few chapters that I will reference, so this book will stay on my shelf.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I respect Orson Scott Card a lot for innovating in his writing and trying new things. Ender's Shadow is a perfect representation of Card at his best. Ender's Shadow is essentially a retelling of Ender's Game through the character of Bean's eyes. While Ender and Bean were both brilliant students at Battle School, Card gives Bean a different and compelling backstory. Unlike Ender, who came from a middle-class American home, Bean rose from the mean streets but has genetically enhanced mental abilities. What I love is how Card toys with the parallel development of Bean and Ender. Ender, the lovable, friendly kid, becomes lonely through the burdens of command. Bean, the rough kid who depends only on himself, learns to form strong bonds with his troops.If you read Ender's Game and liked it, definitely read this book. Then reread Ender's Game again to really appreciate Card's ability to retell a story and make it fresh.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I expected much better sound quality from this product. I can't give a fair review of the rest of its features because as soon as I heard a CD played I packed the thing back up for a refund. My husband bought this to replace the larger radio we currently use hoping to save space in the bathroom. In my opinion it simply isn't worth purchasing if you actually want music to sound GOOD...but what can you expect from $40?,,0

When Edward and Ein left the Bebop crew for good, the rest of the series episodes began going down in flames. Bad move right there. Sappy love stories and cliche rivalies between former friends has given this series a bad name. Hello people!

There is the by-now customary lack of fear among those linked with the victims,which seems very unrealistic, plus family squabbling that gets to be irritating.

There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham.

And if you find you're interested in learning whether or not a particular legend is true or even based in truth, I hope you're the patient type: the author often waits several pages before deciding to comment on the veracity of a story, sometimes saving up multiple stories and commenting on them collectively.

TONE_POLARITY,"Bill Easum has made several important contributions in this book that makes it well worth reading. First, he forces us to think in fuzzy terms about the future of leadership by suggesting that ahead of us are clues rather than rules.Second, he injects a strong element of postmodern thinking into the conversation that forces us to think in nonlinear terms. Third, he is clearly spiritual and Jesus-focused in his clues.Fourth, he has a handle on leadership from an individual perspective, a congregational perspective, and the denominational or larger Church perspective. Fifth, he challenges church leaders about their primary client. Do they serve the congregation, or do they serve Jesus?Sixth, he challenges the church at various levels to anticipate the kind of leadership that will be needed in the 21st century. Seventh, he has a clear focus on helping the church at various levels address the spiritual needs of 21st century preChristians.",,1

Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) is the best pure writer in my personal experience and while I read this book, I have to stop now and then and try to absorb what I just read. It makes me want to go there and the sweep of history is so visible in this book.

Amazon was quite efficient in allowing me to return the damaged disc but the replacement they quickly sent, was no better. Still skipped in sections and had ""dead"" sections... I decided it was too much trouble to return it again. Maybe the recording session was flawed? I'll probably try to get this symphony on another label.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Does it really mix up lump free? Well, not without an immersion blender. The problem is the immersion blender creates a froth with an amazingly amoxicillin aftertaste. The scent is definitely reminiscent of amoxicillin as well. The warmer the water, the easier it dissolves, but the more pronounced the aftertaste becomes.My personal solution has been to mix with hot tap water and an immersion blender, followed by addition of some ice mixed to a slushy consistency; then gently stir in enough lukewarm water to bring it to a temperature you can comfortably just chug-down-and-get-it-over-with. The alternative, for an additional 150 calories or so is to dump in a container of Chobani greek yogurt with fruit and blend to the consistency of a ""smoothy""; the pomegranate and blueberry flavors mask the amoxicillin aftertaste best.Realistically, this is a flavor that can lived with day in, day out, without retching.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I don't know which version I saw, but question how much the translation really mattered since I doubt there were two pages of script in the whole 2 hr. movie. I found it slow and boring and provided no background or answers. It was impossible to tell how the two kids had a relationship other than from loneliness.The kiddie porn reference is because the pasty little boy is shirtless in about half of the movie and then there's the gratuitous shot of the girl's naked crotch which was totally unnecessary. Since she has a 12 year old body forever, no duh that she's going to look like a pubescent kid, a shot of her body wasn't necessary (although I'm sure it wasn't the actress' real body.....one would hope) and added nothing to the film.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I saw this movie ages ago at the video store, rented it, and was blown away. It's one of those films that reminds you never to cheat on your spouse! But like another reviewer said, the wife's son is so wicked that you can't help but blame him for the family's demise. The wife and lover happen into this affair naturally-- how could they resist?This chilling family picnic is the most memorable scene.This is a great indie film that reminds you not to act on every desire because there are prices to pay.One of the few 5 star films. If you see it, you'll agree how good it it. It is dumbfounding how a movie like this is so unheard of.

The book is divided into various levels and utilizes all the strokes. The author also incorporates all the swimming toys (fins, pull buoys, paddles, etc.)The workouts are very creative and enjoyable. I often take the book to the pool (in a nylon bag). This is one of the best workout books I've seen. I purchased it a few years ago and have used it constantly.

TONE_POLARITY,"We enjoyed your book and found it had excellent graphics, however there were a few concerns. On pg 83, it states when suffering from heat exhaustion to ""bath the dog with cold water and especially drench its head"" if one were to do this it would send the animal into an immediate state of cardiac arrest in shock, a condition that no owner is equiped to deal with. I think that any veterinarian would agree, the best course of action would be to slowly cool the animal with tepid water and seek immediate emergency help. As well there is a section stating how much dogs like to eat chocolate but there is no mention to the fact of it being extremely toxic. On the plus side it is nice to see that you recommended that any injured dog should be muzzled as it may bite (something that the owner may not know).",,1

The author states opinion, and then grabs that opinion as fact, which she then goes on to explore in length. While there is a LOT of well written verbiage here, there is little of substance which one can take away. Her parameters for drawing opinions, posing as fact, seem to be too wide.

TONE_POLARITY,"Collectors and film historians alike know why this collection of Korngold film music is a veritable treasure. In the 1960's Warner's made the decision to destroy all the acetate production recordings of dialogue and music in their archives. Luckily, the composer's son,George Korngold, transfered the remaining optical tracks from the original Warner Bros. recording sessions to tape and preserved them in the family archive. Therefore, this collection consists of the only original recordings (apart from composite soundtracks) of Korngold conducting his own music! I think you'll agree...limited sound quality is a small price to pay for the joy of hearing the original scores conducted by the composer at work! Of course this collection is incomplete due to the fact not all the originals sessions were preserved. In fact it was derived from over 20 hours of tape. Love it for what it is...a treasure that was almost lost forever!",,1

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the backpack product was available and competitively priced.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is easily the lousiest ""chic lit"" book I've read. The writing is bland and the characters are poorly fleshed out. More than once the author gets lazy and doesn't even bother to create a character herself but invokes a well-known character in pop culture and expects the reader to just insert that well-known character into her novel. For example, the main character is ""Sarah Jessica Parker, but prettier."" Her office mate is ""Lillith,"" from Cheers and the show Frazier.The main character is the least endearing of any I've seen in a ""chic lit"" book, which is a bad thing considering that so much of the pleasure of reading these novels hinges on the ride the main character takes the reader on.

TONE_POLARITY,"Written in the early 1950s, this novel takes place in 1949 in post-revolutionary China and concerns three Americans, two men and a woman, who have remained to hand over control of a factory to the new government. One of the men, Carl, a boyish innocent, falls in love with the woman, Barbara, who is cold and emotionally repressed, and happens to be the ex-lover of Vern, the other man. The working out of this triangular situation is told rather tediously, with many flashbacks to minor incidents. The subplot of the political takeover of the factory is not well integrated with the romantic theme. Despite the vividness of some scenes, there is a meandering slackness to this novel, undoubtedly the weakest of Dick's mainstream works.",,0

The Seiko will ""remember"" the time, even if the hands no longer turn, and once shaken, it will automatically move the hands to the correct time.The Mido also does not keep accurate time.

TONE_POLARITY,"Apparently lots of people like this book judging from the other reviews below, but I found it incredibly shallow and tedious. It had a premise with a little bit of promise, but the juvenile characterization really put me off. The characters seemed like cardboard cutouts of fantasy archetypes to me. In addition, I often felt like most twelve-year-olds could have seen right through the shallow notions of good and evil Brin works with.Other people who enjoy lighthearted fantasy works may indeed enjoy this. I've enjoyed other fun works of fantasy like The Princess Bride, though I tend to prefer fantasy writers that are more serious, like Tolkein and Stephen R. Donaldson. I haven't read any of Brin's other works, so I don't know whether I have a problem with all of Brin's work, or just with this book in particular.

From such classics as 'Guilty Of Being White' to the awesome 'Look Back' And Laugh', this is one release no self-respecting punk should be without.",,1

The cats, Koko and Yum Yum, and their human, Qwilleran, are always entertaining but this time the storyline was lacking. Maybe the absence of Moose County residents is the reason. We've come to know these folks and they were missing from this adventure. The story takes place on Breakfast Island, the newest 'in' spot. There, Qwill meets and makes new friends but the story just doesn't click. I was much happier to discover our trio of detectives stays home for their next adventure. Meow",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It was refreshing that this book was not so extreme as the ""Natures First Law"" book, of which Steve Arlin is a co-author. However, this book is not sure what it wants to be. Is it a recipe book? Is it a tips-for-eating-raw book? Is it a bodybuilding book? I think the book tries to be all these things, but unfortunately, with such a short length, it can't possibly achieve this. That said, there are some positive aspects to this book, and I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to someone who has already read several other raw-food-related books, and is seeking more information. The author does share some good insights and tips on eating a raw diet. He has been raw for several years, and he does have some good stuff to share. His wife also provides a lot of great recipes (but why is she not credited on the cover of the book?). If you're looking for an exercise program or information specific to body building techniques, you are not going to find much of that here.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I really enjoyed this film and I do not generally enjoy subtitled movies. The characters were believable and I enjoyed watching the relationship between Mehmet and Francesco slowly develop into a physical and emotional bond. The only reason I did not give this film a 5-star rating is because I disliked the ending. I felt that it's message was one about the hopelessness and futility of gay life and that it has no serious future. This is simply untrue. There was no need to make the wife into the type of character she became. Great scenery and a rich introduction into Turkish culture and family life.,,1

There's an issue with that, but still the older map that's preloaded is great. The bluetooth that connects to your cell phone is really cool too.

Dr. Blaylock makes suggestions for how to proceed more effectively if you are going to go the ""traditional"" treatment path and he also provides excellent information for going forward naturally. He also helps you to understand how to decrease your likelihood of getting cancer in the first place and what the best options are to keep it from returning once you've had it. He provides a good overview of both sides of treatment options (natural/traditional). This is an EXCELLENT SOURCE of information for those seeking wisdom on this subject.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This movie is almost unwatchable. It's like Saving Private Ryan crashed into Black Beauty and all the good parts were destroyed.The first act seems to be written for 4 year olds. The script is so sickly sweet it gave me a headache and Director Steven Spielberg seems to have pulled the characters fro the book ""Cliche English characters for dummies"". Once the story moved onto the battlefield the movie makers seemed to give up on the dialogue altogether and we got endless beauty/heroic shots of the horse and main character. This part seems to have been produced with the sole object of making 9 year old girls cry. I can't review the end of the movie because with less than 20 minutes to go I gave up and stopped watching. This shouldn't matter really, because even though I'm a fan of some of Spielbergs' work he very rarely knows how to end his movies.Even worse than War of the Worlds. Don't waste your money.",,0

The song ""Epic Problem"" is good throughout, and Full Disclosure is EXCELLENT except for the horrible screamed verses. Strangelight is awesome too, and not very typical of Fugazi. The Kill is also good in the same way, it's very chilled out. Past these few standout tracks(which wouldn't be standouts at all on any other album of theirs) there isn't much reason to listen to the album.

TONE_POLARITY,"I returned the Sony ICB BM1 due to the loud audible ""click"" it inserts into the recording whenever it is paused. Sony tech support said that it was a characteristic of all BM1's, not just the unit I had. Then I find that the Sony Voice Editor software is incompatible with my Windows XP Media Center pc, and the more current Voice Editor software which came with the BM1 does a ""dirty"" uninstall (leaves it's own dll files in the windows\system folder rather than the Windows dll files it replaced). This caused my Sony ICD MS515 Voice Editor software (an earlier version) not to work. After a week back and forth with Sony tech support, their conclusion is that ALL Sony Voice Editor software is incompatible with Windows XP Media Center pc's, and I was just out of luck that my older Sony ICD MS515 Voice Editor (and the recorder) wouldn't work now after working fine for seven months.

Well you get what you pay for with this product. First this was two advance for her. The age was for 3 years and up so we put it away until she was older. After her 3rd Birthday we pulled it out and tried to play it. The starter DVD got stuck on Sponge Bob and we couldn't play any other game on the DVD. We put in the Blue's Clues game and we played sheets 1 and 2 fine when we had to play sheet #3 it wouldn't work. My 3 year old got very frusturated and started to cry.

One last thing, Joey Coyle is made out to be kind of a Robin Hood for how he was giving his money out.

At Disney land, you can stand in a long line and be bored and when you get to your ride, you are too tired to be excited. Same in this game, spend all day running around and when you get into a battle it is so boring that you might feel like saying, ""wow, this is so cool to be bored.""This game wouldn't hold the attention of a 4 year old.

If it wasn't for the lack of dialouge, plot, good camera work, and dazzling special effects I would have given this movie five stars but it was funny and what else was I going to do for 48 minutes (I fast forwarded through most of it) so I decided to give it a 2. You should see it anyway though because then I'll know that someone else had to watch it too. We can't let great low budget movies vanish from the video archives. We can't let that happen!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I first read the Yellow Rose Trilogy which I loved!!! That is why I bought the California series. I am giving this 2 stars not because it isn't a good book. It would have been a good book if I hadn't read the Yellow Rose Trilogy first. This is more of the same. Boy meets girl. Won't admit their love. Share a common faith. Finally admit they love each other. The only thing different is the names and the town!! Lori Wick is an excellent author and I share her faith in Christ. I just feel this is ""more of the same"".",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Everyone told me how important this book was while I was in undergrad; I still don't see why. The book is unnecessarily hard to read and follow. He uses thousands of words, when a few short paragraphs will suffice. Even my professor admitted he had read it multiple times and still doesn't understand it completely. It's as if he thought being incomprehensible would give his ideas more clout; it actually just shows what a poor writer he was. Not a fan.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have two of these feeders in my yard along with several others and these are always the last to empty if even at all. Most of the time I have to dump the liquid as the birds don't empty it before the liquid begins to rot. Based on my other feeders I think it's the flower that may keep the birds away until they are desperate for food. The birds seem to go after the tube or funnel shaped flowers first and these are just flat. The price was right, so I'm not to upset with the quality.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This game was a big disappointment. I'd even venture to say that it illustrates how NOT to design an educational game. The clumsiness of the game gets in the way of the learning and the fun. The controls - at least for the math game (my daughter and I got fed up and didn't try the others) - are not at all intuitive. Buyers who don't read manuals carefully, beware. But at least you'd think the game would become fun once that wall was scaled. Unfortunately, the mechanism for making Mr. Incredible move the math blocks is so clumsy that, whether you can solve the math problems or not, it's very difficult to move 5 of them to their proper spots in 60 seconds. This seems to leave you stuck at the first level of the game, regardless of your math knowledge. Is the point to have fun and practice math, or to learn how to move blocks?",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this Auto Meter 6391 Cobalt Digital Voltmeter Gauge, obviously, to monitor the charging system in my truck. My 1989 Nissan pickup only has an idiot light to indicate a problem, and I wanted a better way to ensure my alternator was actually charging my battery, and that the battery was holding a charge. After using it for a few weeks now, I can say I've not had any problems at all. The indicator is large and bright enough to see even in broad daylight. It has a lead to connect to the vehicle's lights, but I haven't hooked it up, and don't know why I would ever need to. I checked a local trucking supply house for this meter, and the best they could do was order it for me for $135. I got it from Amazon for around $88 plus shipping. There are cheaper meters out there, but this brand seems to have a good reputation, and like I said, I've had no problems at all. I'm very happy with this meter.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,This was a decent unit when it was new. I used one for years but when Comcast got above 7 meg (now 22) this could not perform above 7.

We all started out quiet, but once we started to get more competitive we wer yelling answers at the top of our lungs!

TONE_POLARITY,"Full, rich sound with a thoughtfully-organized rear panel and an impressive roster of DSP modes. Very easy to set up and use. My only complaint: The device can't remember individual channel settings for separate source inputs. For example, I like to watch DVDs with the center channel set at +5 dB, so that dialogue pops more clearly. But for music, I prefer to use a surround mode with the center channel at -5, which increases the field depth to my ears. With this receiver, that's impossible unless I want to get used to changing the settings every time I switch back and forth. Different DSP modes are retained for each source, but the more granular audio and channel settings are system-wide. Not a huge inconvenience, but important to know if you want a high level of control over your listening experience.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"When my book club selected this title I was more than a little skeptical, especially since it was written in a very different style than I was used to and billed as a 'young adult' book. Once I started reading it I became swept up in it. It was very interesting to view the events of WWII Germany through the eyes of German people who were not captivated by Hitler's rhetoric. It is easy to forget there were brave souls who, in their own ways, protested his iron rule, often risking their own lives and comfort to do so. The Book Thief would be an excellent companion to The Diary of Anne Frank. This book should be a must read for every adult and young adult. It is a book that stays with you long after you have finished the last chapter.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As other 2-star reviewers have mentioned, this book is extremely simple and basic in its treatment of scientific writing. Really, to write well you need: practice and correct English beaten into you.Does cover how editors handle your paper, and that's really the only detailed section, the whole book could then be around 30 pages. If you wrote a paper on the computer in high school with a graph or picture, circa 1998, you were more technologically advanced than several of the sections in the book, most scientists were ahead of that.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I was excited to get this book for I hoped it would further my understanding into a subject I had increasingly grown interested in...The criminal mind. When flipping through it, it seems like a great read, complete with case studies and forensic psychologyLittle did I know that this was a huge step backwards and to the side from other books I had read on the subject. Not only was it not interesting AT ALL, I was horrified to realize that this even begins going into other subjects that are not even close to being scientific in nature.If you want to read about Freud or Graphology (which is a joke--about as scientific as phrenology) thats fine. But don't expect those scientifically invalid interpretations of the mind to help you better understand the fast moving pace of research and experimentation that is forensic science.Instead stick with Mindhunter, the Crime Classification Manual, or anything that has a research bibliography in the back.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,Applied Stochastic Hydrogeology is easily the best book of this century in its field.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a war spy film about a group of Japanese men placed in the US as a fifth column, taking the place of businessmen. I was intrigued by it because it sounds like ""the hundred days of the dragon"" that was an early Outer Limits episode. Unfortunately, the film has simply terrible acting, with the exception of the mysterious mastermind as played by Lugosi. The men are like sleeper agents, waiting to be activiated by hypnotism. It comes off as both unbelievable and unbearably slow, with wooden dialogue and the crudest stereotypes of ""the enemy"" that one can imagine.Not recommended.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I got this a week ago and it is perfect. Very durable! All adjustments are easy and isn't even hard to do while the water is running. Some of the reviews here say that it has problems but there are no issues at all. If you play around with the thing a bit you learn what each adjustment piece does and it is easy. It shoots water very far but that can be controlled with the top metal flap, on the slow clockwise pattern it launches water far but then on the counterclockwise return it gets the stuff closer to it, everything gets watered. There is a tad bit of overspray on the sides but that is inherent in this type of sprinkler's design. When the arm slaps the water to cause it to turn a little tiny bit sprays to the side, it is minimal and really shouldn't be worried about whatsoever. I bought a LOT of sprinklers before this one, this is by far the best one in this price range. Don't let the negative reviews persuade you, this is a great sprinkler.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,We received this toy as a gift and I wish we never had. We spent hours and hours trying to get the thing to work. We even bought a new DVD player trying to get it to work.

The cursor to select the games also sometimes does not work.I would NOT recommend this toy. It is NOT user friendly.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I am a huge Tom Clancy fan, but this book was just painful to read. I cannot think of another book I've read which is so breathtakingly repetitive. The dialogue is canned, and is practicly recycled every few chapters. There is an immensely preachy edge to this book, and I don't know if it reflects Clancy's beliefs (I hope not), or is meant to engage us in the utterly shallow characters. This book might have made a decent short story of around 30 or 40 pages, but as a full length novel it is boring and trite.

I don't mind shelling out a few bucks more special edition blu-rays but when greedy studio executives try get more money from us in this economy it completely amazes me the mindset of people.

TONE_POLARITY,"i like the controls and the plot, but i guess it may just be not realistic enough for me. im a huge fan of resident evil 4 and other shooting games.. i also think the 'text' when people are talking is a little lame, i would have thought a next-gen game that was as important as zelda would have real voices at this point.. but overall a very entertaining game and definitely worth the 50 hours it takes to beat",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old, he likes it but everytime he shakes the rattle pooh won't wiggle and play music, I have to shake the rattle for him to work. Pooh will wiggle and play music based on noise, but as for the rattle working like a remote control, as advertised, it does not work unless an adult is using it, which defeats the whole purpose.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Though not enough of the actual racing makes the cut, the reality of family life comes through! As a Dad with two daughters (we're not in the racing business!) I can relate to the story line. They are an American icon family. and it's great to see that they have been documented on film. Better than your average flick. I would highly recommend seeing them race in person, and recommend this DVD to those who have seen them in action. A great look into a real family, as harsh as it may seem. Go Force Racing!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Design Synectics is a stand out browse and reference text for Art educators. I would also highly recommend this book to any creative person. It is like a service manual for the artist/ divergent thinker. Presenting individual visual and cognitive concepts in a schematic that is easy to read and fun to practice. While some of the action items in this book may seem a little too structured, individual educators will have little trouble in customizing the approaches to fit with their style. While many books written for Art teachers only give outdated product based ideas, Design Synectics gives insight into the thinking associated with visual literacy. This book is a true Art educator staple.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,These are great for frying eggs. My husband was amazed that they did not melt into a puddle while making his sunny side up breakfast. I have to agree with the writer who thought the notch on the handle to be uncomfortable. It kinda digs into your hand and these will discolor in chili or spaghetti sauce. Just a warning. Overall they are good but if you can stretch to buy the Le Crueset then spend the extra $$.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,If you read the back cover of this book then you basically know what is going to happen . However the advertised third force is a furphy and is unsatisfactorily set aside . This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller .,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I remember watching this movie some years back and it upset me greatly at the time. I decided to buy it now as I am a collector of true stories. I feel this is absolutely the best acting from Sally Field, It did still upset me to think a mother could do such things to a little girl, but we cant stick our heads in the sand, this did happen and thank God she met the doctor that could help her live somewhat a normally life. A Great movie, so sad but still a great movie.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Let me be quick and blunt. This is not a serious movie. It is a hyperbole, so to speak. It's over the top, and purposely so. You will not find the answer to life's mysteries in this movie. It is a fun, action movie, with great action sequences, and some hilarious moments. The acting is above average and the writing is good. The plots starts strong and fizzles out a bit toward the end. The ending itself was pretty bad, but this didn't really matter so much due to the fact that there was no mystery to solve, no question to answer, no big world-changing events. It was just a cool movie, worth a good watchin' every now and then. Some people reviewing this are taking it way too seriously....but it's great for what it is - a good way to kill 2 hours. It could be correctly classified as a comedy in my book.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"It's weird. If you're like me, when you're interested in a game, you go online and research. Check the reviews etc. the problem is: there's just no consistency on these reviews! So I took a calculated risk and bought Godzilla: Domination. Not the best use of your hard earned gaming dollars. The graphics are nice, the control is so-so, the sound, very simplistic. The real problem is that this game is quickly reduced to button-mashing. There are only a few basic moves available but they are all the moves you need to beat this game in about 20 minutes. That's right, TWENTY MINUTES! You can literally trap an opponent in a corner and just never let them up. BOOOOORING! The special moves are cool but you don't need them, in fact it will take you longer to learn how to use the special moves effectively than it will to beat the game by simply pressing ""A"" or ""B"" repeatedly. Take a pass, trust me on this.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have the 1966 edition of this book. I was amazed to find it still in print because fashions in technical graphics have changed so much in 30 years.One of my soapbox topics is the poor way our colleges teach engineers and physicists three-dimensional visualization. The most excellent drawings in this book enable the student to see three-dimensional objects even though they are rendered by techical graphics as a sequence of two-dimensional drawings.In spite of its title, no mathematics is involved. Descriptive geometry is a layout and drawing skill. The first three chapters would benefit any wood or sheet-metal worker. Some of the later chapters would benefit geometrically oriented sculptors.Best of breed!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased these bags when I returned to work and began pumping more often. What a waste!! The twist tie design is both clumsy and ineffective. You can never tie them tight enough and spills are frequent. In additon to this, the cost is ridiculous. The Gerber bags with the zip lock design are much more economical and are leak proof. They can be found at most retail stores including Target and Walmart. These bags do not measure up to the Medela name and they should consider a new design. Returning to work and continuing to nurse your baby is hard enough without the hassle of these bags.",,0

From what I can judge so far, it is a very detailed study of the Shikoku pilgrimage, its historical evoulution and its significance from religious and cultural aspects. The text is very well written and I have found the narration very interesting even though this book or its subject would not arouse much enthusiam among many if judged only by its title. The authour is commended for the quality of his presentation. The book will be extremely very useful to me and my wife who intend to embark on this pilgrimage as soon as we have sufficient funds.The condition of the used book I purched was good and I am happy with it.ThanksChandra",,1

Such as Lara Croft, Star Wars, Star Trek, Krull, Shrek, Dune, The Matrix and I know I found more, but would have to watch it again to name them all, which I have no intention of doing.

There are many garden companies that offer pre-designed gardens, but they're expensive and sometimes have plants that you just don't care for. This book gives you ideas, plans, tips on how to combine plants in such a way that it looks like a professional landscaper came and did all the work. Every design is wonderful, the photography is superb and the gardens are beautiful. A real asset for anyone who wants to have a beautiful garden without paying a designer/landscaper to do it for you.

TONE_POLARITY,"This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I think the book is good and although I am not a physician, I trust what he is saying in the book, just find it unrealistic. My day is full. I look for time to just plain relax. How am I suppose to follow these restrictive diets and cook or eat plenty of vegetables when time is of the essence? Until this country adopts vegetables as a necessary option (in fast food restaurants for example) these diets are unrealistic. At least for me. Personally, I find it easier to exercise three times a week and try to eat as healthy as possible. But the diet recommended in this book is for either people with enough time on their hands or people with plenty of money to eat at restaurants with healthy food. Dr. Mercola may be a good physician but he is unrealistic in his views. He also promotes a no vaccine policy. Is this a good idea? Makes me wonder...",,0

I didn't believe it until I actually bought this copy of Goodfellas myself, but the production crew of this DVD were gracious enough to stick in their very own intermission in the middle of this 2 1/2 hour film. No, there wasn't one in the theatrical release, but there is an extraordinarily annoying and unnecessary one here. For in the middle of this incredibly entertaining movie it suddenly stops. The viewer must then get up and flip the DVD over to watch the second half of the film. !!!!NO KIDDING!!!! Why didn't Warner Brothers just release this on 8-track!!!! Totally unacceptable!!!! I actually thought I had received a bootleg copy through Amazon and requested an exchange . . . . but the joke is on me, because this is how the studio intended it for home viewing!!!!

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased a Yukon Game Gamble about 2 months ago prior to the Kentucky upcoming deer season. During my hunt, I killed a large 10 point buck with a bow and used the Yukon Game Gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal. This item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around 160 - 180 lbs with little to no effort. The instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly. This is definitely an item every hunter needs. I will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends. Thanks Yukon.... Rick",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It's not that this is a BAD book, it's just ordinary. It does, however, have some nice moments and interesting characters. As the other reviewer noted, the huge surprise was not treated as a significant event, but I found nothing wrong with the ending otherwise.There were awkward moments and subplots not fully explained or left to dangle, but overall it was a fairly pleasant read -- especially at a season when so few books are worth cracking open.",,0

The DVD portion is quiet and the transition back to a cable channel is fast and soundless. Bottom Line. If you are watching something you don't your wife to know about use the DVD.

TONE_POLARITY,"First off, this book is for TRUMPET.The ""Essential Elements 2000: A Comprehensive Band Method"" is a great book for a young person who is learning an instrument for the first time. There is a fingering chart in the back of the book to make looking up fingerings quick and easy. The book starts off very basic with the parts of the instrument. The easiest notes to play and finger are presented first with exercises to practice them. This book comes with a play-along CD. This CD includes all solo exercises.Hal Leonard also offers (though not through Amazon) band sets for band directors. They are simple arrangements of music that correlate with the book. They are great for the first concert.There is an older version of this book called ""Essential Elements: A Comprehensive Band Method"". The book is purple and has many of the same features as this one, but the CDs have to purchased separately.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I have used this Bosch drill for a few months now and love it. To go along with the drill I also bought the Clic-Change, hex screwdriver bits, and hex shank drill bits. The Clic-Change makes life a whole lot easier by being able to switch bits quickly. The drill is small enough to fit in places that others can not. Plus, the weight and balance is such that you can drill all day without fatigue. The Bluecore battery charges in just minutes. I have also dropped the drill a couple of times and it hardly has a scratch on it. I also really love the 2 speeds. The first speed is for screws and the higher speed is for drilling holes. The 2 speeds match perfectly to the job. I highly recommend this Bosch drill.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Mr Whittle is a skilled writer. However his fiction should be written for adults, where the problems won't affect impressionable minds.The first thing that disturbed me was the poor English of Quon Lee.

It's not true that ""Chinese tongues"" are unable to make the l sound, etc. Add that to the portrayal of the Jewish tailor as always whining, you get ""old-fashioned"" in the bad sense of the term.Then Lizzy was involved in smuggling, in effect stealing from the government & those obeying the law. Then blackmail. It's not OK to blackmail someone even when that someone isn't a good person.And I certainly don't think that people kept in a barrel would be alive at the end of a week.

Also, the tie in the front of the bandana looks ""dorky"" - something I'd be willing to overlook if the product worked. Even during the first hour, the bandana didn't fit snugly against the skin because the ice insert is stiff. This product is a huge disappointment and a waste of money.

I was amazed!This cleaner isn't for all-over carpet cleaning. But it is wonderful for little (and not so little) spots and stains, without using elbow grease!

It cleaned up quite well, there was a light scattering of snow left behind, but you would find that using a regular shovel, too. It throws the snow forward, so you need to plan out the path that you'll be shoveling - you don't want to throw snow onto an area that you just cleaned up.

TONE_POLARITY,"Sigh. I loved Secret Life of Bees and was really looking forward to this book but it falls flat, in my humble opinion. I am not done with it yet (am on page 205--can anyone tell me it gets better?) but the writing and characters, and the setting and plot do not measure up with the drama of Secret Life. So far in the book, the main protagonists, Jessie and Whit, are so shallow and cliche, their arguments for breaking their respective vows are not convincing. Jessie separates from her husband in a conversation that took about two paragraphs and he went running back to the mainland....that just seemed weird to me. There are some ""sort of"" interesting characters, Kat and Hepzibah for example, but they are not enough to save the book. I am going to soldier on to see how it ends, but it is painful. The author had a real problem here in that Secret Life was a tough act to follow. Ms. Kidd should stick with chronological adolescents, not middle aged people acting like adolescents.",,0

However, as noted in other reviews, the guides are awful. They do not do a good job of guiding the hair to the blades, making your trimming look uneven and sloppy. Another problem I have had is when trimming without the guides the blade unit has a tendecy to pop right out of the shaver. Sure it easily snaps back into place, but itis annoying and can easily mess up what you are doing. This product is a great idea, but something really needs to be done about how well it works with the guides, as I don't always want to go down to bare skin.",,0

The upgrade was painless and the new operating system is a major improvement.As for the Ipod the directions could be much clearer and for this I take away one star. All in all the ipod works as billed; it sounds great and the design is very functional, and it looks really cool.
