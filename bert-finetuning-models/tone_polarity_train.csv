TONE_POLARITY,this a great buy i highly recommend this purchase. had a funky smell on the inside but that was from the stuff they used to fill it but i washed it in the sink and the smell inst as bad.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this book in order to learn all I could about the Pekingese breed. I wasn't disappointed. It's nicely written, very informative and easy to read. (The wonderful photos are an added bonus.) Caroline Coile obviously has a long-time, loving relationship with the Peke. After reading it, I was convienced. We adopted our own Peke and now use it daily to learn more about the needs of our wonderful new family member. The information is very informative, helpful and acurate. We and our dog are much happier due to the information we gained from Dr. Coile's book. What a bargin!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,Great volume of knowledge and detail. My elderly parents are already showing signs of much-improved health. Mother (a diabetic) has dramatically decreased her blood sugar readings. The whole family is very grateful for this life-extending program!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Me and my husband picked this up for my 22 month old daughter. The newly enhanced color was great..but I found the film still to be a bit dark compared to the cartoons of today. I know, I know they did what they could and in these times cartoons have come a LONG way. My daughter might be a tad young for this because she seemed to lose interest alot. I think once she gets older she will enjoy it more. It still was a great investment in a wonderful Disney classic.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Received saw, immediately set to cutting simple straight cut mahogany. This is without a doubt the worst saw I have ever used. I can't understand why this saw is so terrible, aside of the fact that the teeth looked completely unsharpened! They appeared to be stamped and not sharpened as though the saw missed an entire step on the assembly line. I was looking to replace a 10 year old, never sharpened, Stanley straight back saw. This saw left exit tear-out 10 times worse than that ancient saw.Sent it back the day after I bought it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This made a great gift for my roommate. It was nice to have something that was wanted and has original art from the author.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Everything about command hooks is awesome. They do a consistently good job, and I have bought just about one of every one of their line of products. These hooks are great for holding up your broom or other larger items in a closet or storage area. Because they are kind of ugly plastic, I wouldn't put them in a public area, but then that is not what they are for, so they still get a 5 star review.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,Ive sanded 2 vehicles with this sander and still works great. Im sure that it will perform well on wood as well. With the right paper. Has much more power than I expected. My former sander was a Matco that cost better than 200. and it out performs it easily.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The My Scene dolls are such posers! They're nothing but wanna'be Bratz (and need I remind you that the Bratz are way cooler!) This Masquerade Madness doll is a copy of the Funk n' Glow Bratz and she doesn't even look half as pretty. Why can't Mattel just except the fact that ""Barbie's Pink Reign of Idiotic Terror"" is OVER. GIVE UP MATTEL MY SCENE HAS NOTHING ON THE BRATZ DOLLS!~From: Kazami Ami a BRATZ fan",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this and only used it a few times. Now the darn thing won't run. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this product. When it was working, it was OK but now I feel like this was a total waste of my money and I would not recommend this to anyone.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is a nifty book. Peter Gordon, sailor,sleuth, and small town lawyer is the engaging narrator of this fast paced thriller that begins on the Jersey shore and never flags for a second with non-stop bi-coastal action, multiple murders, and a boatload of suspects. Sure-footed dialogue and high-flying legal maneuvering in executive suites from Philadelphia to LA kept me guessing and intrigued right to the end. Put on your Docksiders and jump aboard for a great read.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Amazing vocals, great beats, no ballads, definitely a party album, very unique project like nothing i've ever heard two thumbs up.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Bone-shaking, soul-piercing flamenco-blues and flamenco-jazz. The musicians are phenomenally talented and innovative. This is a classic album that transcends genre.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I have used a similar Fiskars model for various household and classroom purposes for years, but after buying this class pack to supply my Montessori classroom I am disappointed. The handles are loosely bonded to the blades so that the tips do not always meet fully. This is frustrating for young scissor apprentices as well as for more experienced users.That said, I have not found a better model at this price. Also, the handles are nearly a perfect size and shape, so I would hesitate to recommend another pair. I would just like to see a better quality build from Fiskars.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Superb! That's the only word I find to qualify this excellent compilation. Once you buy it, stop listening to it becomes impossible. The day it arrived I listened to it three times in a row. I've known only ""I like Chopin"" from the 80's, I think no other music from Gazebo has been played on radio in Brazil during all these years. I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""I like Chopin"". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's. I really loved ""Wrap the rock"", ""Gimmick"", ""For Anita"" and ""Telephone Mama"". Although the price of 29 dollars plus shipping and the 60% tax I paid to my country's customs it was completely worthy awhile. Thanks for Amazon and Gazebo for this really enjoyable cd !",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"An appalling book.Boring, poorly written, poorly edited.Try Algorithm design manual by Steven S. Skiena or Thomas H. Cormen's Introduction to Algorithms or Kleinberg and Tardos'Algorithm Design or the excellent Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany V. Levitin instead of this mish-mash.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This ground loop isolator made absolutely zero difference. When I connected a different brand of ground loop isolator, everything was fine. Stay away from the Raptor unless you like to waste your money.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have to agree with mis_led from Mich. - see if you can pick it up on discount. I loved seeing the show again, but the price was high for only 8 eps. Works out to about almost $6.00 (U.S.) per episode. I was not able to find the ""Hidden Messages to Leapers"" promised on the box. Also, there is a pocket for a booklet, much like the box sets of Babylon 5, but there is no booklet.The episodes them selves were fun to watch. You can see how things changed between season 1 and 2. It was funny to hear Ziggy refered to as ""he"" when in later seasons Ziggy has a female voice.The box is nice, loved the vortex look. Hope the keep that for future season.Over all, while I found it a bit lacking in the bonus', and expensive on a per ep cost, am glad I picked it up and look forward to the next set.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Got the link cable in a small envelope. Came with the cable in a small plastic bag. Hooked it up to a Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance and it didn't work. I don't know if the product was wrong, or the thing just doesn't work? I wouldn't suggest getting this product.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,Remember Me was one of the best books I have ever read. The characters were perfectly developed and the plot was wonderful. It was the kind of book that kept you guessing until the very end. I have read about 23 of Christoper Pike's books and have not been disapointed once. His books kind of give you an insight into the way he thinks and it is really amazing. I would reccomend this series to anyone.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Adam Scott wasn't really on my radar but I caught him in the last Season 2 episode of Eastbound and Down. A couple nights later, ""The Vicious Kind"" was on one of my cable channels. Good God. He has such a delicate face, but with the facial hair, it seemed to help in changing his persona. Really good movie and he was smoking hot in it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,It's not much different from the movie. Aside it is great comic relief for one who likes light-heart humor. It just a great TV series..,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"McDowell's first section in this book, ""The Bible - I trust it"" should tell you all you need to know about his ""evidence"". His argument is that the Bible is unimpeachable and therefore is acceptable as 100% truth. So, inevitably, he uses the age-old circular argument: Christianity must be true because the Bible says it is. I expected OH SO MUCH more.And this, after the book jacket claims to provide ""Answers which will satisfy anyone who is willing to honestly weigh the evidence."" Too bad the author wasn't willing to offer up any non-tainted evidence.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought three of these to get my sons' bicycles off the garage floor. Mounted them easily, but used real screws. the ones that came with the package were soft, and the heads stripped easily.I've read other reviews that the rope was cheap, and I agree. But, its useable for now. Might need replaced if you use the hoist a lot.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This book will guide you to the best of Paris.I'm french, and I well know Paris. trust me, It's a real good job, even for french people.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The plastic is way too thin and flimsy to work with. It is a big hassle to try to attach to your cage and in the end it doesn't stay secured for 5 minutes. The velcro pieces don't stick to anything. The plastic scratches by just unrolling it. And they charge you so much in shipping because they ship it in a 5"" skinny roll in a 16"" box! I found this product to be a big waste of money and of packaging.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This is a great toy to have!I would ride it every chance I had.I think it is well priced. It is fun for 6-9 years of age.When I got the E-100 a lot of my friends saw me riding it and they got it too.This a fun toy to have and you should buy it!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I used this book for an online class, books and test are bundled together and each time I took the test I had to challenge at lest one question, because it was simply wrong or inaccurate. Test quiz/test questions are non constructive for the most part. Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"the light is very weak, not nearly as bright as i thought it would be and the coil part doesn't stand up on its own like the picture shows. i have to make sure its propped up against something. i was very disappointed and will not order one of these again.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I once heard a teenage box office salesman describe Chekov's Three Sisters as ""three hours about not going to Moscow."" That's pretty much how I feel about this crap novel. Maguire creates setup after setup that have no payoff. The characters are static and thin, the weak drama makes daytime TV seem edgy...I just can't overstate my distaste for this novel. Maguire seems to have tried something that's way beyond his reach. I can't believe he's built a career exploiting L. Frank Baum's fictional universe. Carpet baggery.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I enjoyed the various characters who took the bus ride to the afterlife. Some carried their sinful ways with them and didn't make it to the mountain (heaven). The observer who told the story seemed very humble to me and I liked him right away. It was interesting to read the descriptions of the afterlife from C.S. Lewis' perspective.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I like Bill Murray a lot, wish him well, and hope he can eventually transition to serious acting roles. But in this ludicrous adaptation of a substantive novel, he simply cannot pull it off. That famous smirk is always there, right below the surface. I expected him to break into an SNL skit at any moment, destroying any pretense of real drama. Go see Groundhog Day instead.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I recently purchased a ZUNE (less than six weeks ago), plugged it in last night to charge and woke up this morning with a cracked LED screen. Because it was over the 30 day return policy, the store I purchased it at told me, ""Sorry, SOL. Try Microsoft."" Microsoft basically told me I was SOL. They admitted that ""if there were a hairline crack in the screen, the battery basically heats up and causes the screen to crack completely."" The support guys final reply, ""Not Microsoft's fault, each unit is tested before shipping. It would be speculation to say that maybe the unit was purchased like that. Not our problem""So now I am stuck with a very expensive Zune that is useless.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"We've been using Advantage for cats on our kitty for four months, and decided to switch the dog over to Advantage too. After application, the dog shook, spraying little drops of it all over our living room. Any plastic the product hit (including the glossy black frame and base of our plasma TV) immediately developed PITS in the plastic, even though I grabbed a cloth to wipe it clean as soon as it happened. A Google search for ""Advantage flea"" and ""plastic"" shows that this has happened before and actually endangered an animal. Make sure you use caution when applying this product!! It's a good flea preventative, but this side-effect is not documented or warned about on the package.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Any collection of Robert W Chambers's ""King in Yellow"" stories is a rare and welcome gift, and the best of those stories--""The Yellow Sign,"" ""The Repairer of Reputations,"" and ""In the Court of the Dragon""--are included in this volume. Curiously, however, others are omitted in favor of tales that, though quite good, simply don't seem to be part of the KIY cycle. The missing stories, in this reviewer's opinion, are as follows: ""The Prophet's Paradise,"" ""The Street of the Four Winds,"" ""The Street of the First Shell,"" ""The Street of Our Lady of the Fields,"" and ""Rue Barree."" Had the current volume included these tales, I would have given it the highest possible marks. Still, it is an excellent collection that I highly recommend to anyone interested in the work of the inestimable and terribly underrated Robert W. Chambers.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Having read several good reviews from various critics, I lookedforward to this book's paperback release for some time. Unfortunately,while Lott seems to be have an adequate grasp of the language, hisstorytelling skills just do not rise to the same level.A whodunit of sorts is marred by an overly tedious narrative and far-too-convenient plot twists that ultimately lead to a flat climax. Furthermore, the story is tied up just a tad too neatly--when the person........... You've no doubt seen any number of cheesy James Bond villains do the exact same thing (""Since I am going to kill you very soon, Mr. Bond, it doesn't matter if I let you in on my little secret, does it?""). Ugh. Take a pass on this one--it's not worth the effort. END",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I honestly can say that I intended to buy this book for my mother this coming mother's day. I don't really care who the 'author' was, I just wanted a nice book to put in a basket with some other gifts. I bought it and read it first. Please. I am a sincere person, and I simply cannot believe that the publisher thinks this book is good quality. Without the name Britney Spears it would be sitting on the discount rack, if it was ever published at all. A silly story with no heart or guts. Painfully written, I hope that Brit and her mother either get out of the writing business or take a few high school writing courses.Please, do not waste your money.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I wanted to lose 15 lbs so i used this shake with 1 scoop of the herbalife protein, and 3 weeks later, still no weight loss. I would not recommend this product for weight loss, but rather breakfast. It filled me up when i drank it, but I decided to go back to eating chicken twice a day for weight loss and yogurt for b'fast. This definitely works. I just wanted something simpler, but this product is definitely not it for me. I was even doing cardio while using herbalife and it didn't work. I will not be repurchasing this product.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I bought this printer for its features and the name HP. Now I have little opinion of either. You can get it to print wireless and the fax works well. When you venture into wireless world all bets are off. It won't even install correctly. I have a belkin N router which works fine. I use the wireless wizard on the printer to connect to the router and then the trouble starts. This printer won't scan and it won't print from another wireless computer. There is no patch or fix for this you are stuck with it. I am sorry I bought this POS.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,This DVD was quite disapointing. The structure was choppy. The overall look was cheesey and rough. And quite frankly I just can't warm up to Neon. I have a another video where she is part of an ensemble and she's the low point even among lesser known instructors.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,I was disappointed in this toy. I bought it for my 6 year old grandson and didn't even give it to him for Christmas. I was ashamed to give it. I looks like a piece of junk. It says 643 pcs but it looks more like 25. I just put it away and will give it to him some other time when a nice gift isn't expected. I would not buy anymore of these erector sets.. Disappointed Nana.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,Obviously the instructions for this were written in another country. Some words completely mispelled. This may explain why screws and bolts were used interchangably and the parts list did not match with the number of times in the instructions that they told you to use it. (i.e. part B was a bolt and only supposed to have 2 but in the instructions were told to use at least 6 times. Some bolts/screws completely missing. Going to try to return to the store.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"When my daughter was born at 27 weeks I bought about 8 books about Preemies! This is the ONLY one that I would recommend to other parents. It is easy find answers to specific questions and explains things very clearly. While there is no substitute for getting an explanation directly from your child's neonatologist, the book often gave me enough information to ask better questions and ask about things that may not have been addressed. I found this book to be an excellent resource even after my daughter left the NICU. That was a little over 2 years ago and I have a happy,healthy,beautiful, and very smart little girl! Get this book!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Good information on the periods, materials and types of antique boxes most frequently collected. Photography excellent and item pricing accurate. I love this book and it's helped me enormously.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The McCade books are very good, among my all-time faves, but they're getting a bit repetitive. At least this time around there aren't any assasins, but in Alien Bounty McCade manages to wind up in chains not once but TWICE, and once again manages to get rescued by his buds, Rico, eversoheavily armed, and Phil, once a slave himself. In the next novel, McCade's Bounty, our galactic space hero's daughter is enslaved by the space pirates. I swear, I would be suprised if in McCade's world anyone lower in status than Lakorian royalty was NOT a slave at some point, considering the stats. Also, the part in Alien Bounty about Mustapha Pong is a bit short. Other than those two points, though, MCCADE ON THE RUN excels. It weaves an intricate, complex universe in its diverse worlds, some of which entirely artificial. Dont expect any of that ""Oh, it's a lava world"" nonsense.This book deserves 4.5 stars, but hey, I'm a pessimist.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The Secret Garden written by Frances Hodgson Burnnet is a traditional literature that's great for reading at night.

Mary on the other hand meets Collin and they become best friends. But will any other of Mary's friends tell anyone about the garden?I don't like this book because most of it is written in Yorkshire and it's very hard to read.If you like to read books that are difficult to understand then this book is perfect for you.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"We bought this book for my daughter who has just started a relationship. This book teaches almost the opposite of what we have been teaching at home. The author instructs that dating should be just for fun. He also states quite vehemently that their dating relationships will not last, but also says that dating is practice for marriage. How is having multiple dating partners in High school a good practice for having a lifelong committment down the road? We need to teach our daughters to date responsibly. A better book to read is ""The Truth About Guys"" by Chad Eastman. It reveals things about guys while building a girl's self-esteem.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I happen to like this bag even though it's not what I was hoping for.I would like it better if it were more of a cloth type messenger, but the material is tough enough to carry some tools and the occasional knife or two.I have carried a laptop with it and it holds it quite nicely. There's not a lot of 'compartmenting' with the bag, but it does quite nicely for the quick throw over your shoulder and take it with you thing. I use it on a daily basis to carry some of my essentials and have even used it as a 'diaper bag' when taking my 18 month old out to the mall or the park.Excellent bag for the price.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I'd say that this is well worth the money. the only draw-back is that it cannot rotate the camera in a circle at all. This is very much a 1-shot camera. It CAN tilt up and down and can even flip the camera on its side 90 degrees and hold it there.I do have an issue with mine ,as well where the part that connects to the camera has a wing nut that will not move like it should to make for easy connection to the camera. Pretty annoying. Not sure if all models are like this or just mine. Am looking into it.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I have to quote from another review here- from an Apollo program engineer:""I finally gave up listing the errors I found in this book"" I concur. This book is (to quote the hospital tech in the film ""The Right Stuff"", ""...b-a-d, BAD"". While I was exposed to Apollo program engineering as a youth, my era of engineering experience is after the fact, but being an American spaceflight historian and a believer in either being accurate (otherwise, why bother?) or at the least show the attempt(!) this one is just not good- full of supposition, and statistics that can be verified if one makes the attempt. Get ""First Man"" by James Hansen- it's the authorized bio of Neil A. and is cool (for me anyway) in that he even takes the reader back generations leading up to the creation of a truly heroic human.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This book is written for those people who want to read trash about Eva Peron. I stopped counting how many times he called her a 'little whore' and all the references to her 'whore's mouth'. It is disgusting.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,Nice novel-had a satisfying feel at the end. I liked that the main character cobbled together a living. Lots of people put together a life in odd or disparate ways but you don't often find them in novels. I found this novel a convincing evocation of a certain kind of urban life.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Well, I've been waiting for this game for a very long time, however, it just didn't pay off for me. Can I just say, that I really tried to like this game! I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a kid when the very first Final Fantasy came out on the original Nintendo. While, the characters and story and graphics are amazing... the battle system just kills the game for me. I know that Final Fantasy was probably trying to appeal to a new demographic, and perhaps the series has left me behind. I have tried over and over again to like this game, I just can't get past the ""over and over"" battle tubes... I feel like this game is just one repeat after another. I just wasn't able to keep interest in the game. For the first time, Final Fantasy has disappointed me, and for the very first time, I won't complete a Final Fantasy game.

TONE_POLARITY,"I do not like Tuchman's 'style' of writing. At first I thought she must be a Brit because her sentences are long and rambling and frankly almost impossible in some cases to interpret. They run together and I have to just wade through page by page. Very interesting subject matter but the book is much more like a text book of the history of China than a book on Stilwell. I understand the background history is of utmost importance but she jumps back and forth and many times I have to go back to find dates for the time she is talking about. Not sure I will be able to make it though this book. I've been to China 6 times, Taiwan two times and have a historical background but it hasn't helped much with this book.Fascinating subject matter however. Just seems like someone should have proof read better and re-arranged a lot of her sentences that are a paragraph long and future present or some such thing!",,0

The idea of using an APPROPRIATE and RELEVANT scriptural verse (or any other short sentence or idea that is pertinent) seems to me to be a great way to say a rosary and meditate on the desired mystery...using just ANY-OL' verse, even a scriptural one, not-so-much....sounds like just-so-much distraction away from what a rosary is meant to be and accomplish.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is a very dark book-even darker than the Lily Bard series. I have always enjoyed Ms. Harris' books-especially the humor and characterizations of the characters. None of that was present in this book-it was populated with deeply negative characters and the storyline itself was negative and depressing.I found the intense-and borderline psychotic-neediness and dependency of Harper to be very unattractive and unsettling. I, like previous reviewers, just don't like weak, needy women.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"These headphones are amazing! I had been looking for lightweight, wireless headphones for years - I even bought a couple that were either very heavy or just didn't work.As other reviewers have mentioned, these headphones work best when you turn off your tv's speakers and adjust the volume on the tv and headphones; I encounter major static when I don't do this (this is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). Otherwise, they are perfect and, on my recommendation, my brother - who demands perfection - also bought them and also loves them.Good job, Sennheiser!Update:I have been using these headphones for more than two years now and they still work as good as new (and I use them almost every day).

TONE_POLARITY,"I really like the concept of this machine. I use it sporadically, mostly to store grain, flour, etc. However, while it worked fine initially it progressively has had more and more trouble pulling enough of a vacuum to seal (the sealing part of the machine is only activated when the vacuum reaches a certain point). Now it is totally useless. The rubber seals look to be in good condition and I don't recall any trauma that occurred, such as liquid being sucked into the machine, etc. I don't think that I even used the machine to seal more than 50 bags before it stopped working.

So far he hasn't been able to use it. He called the number for help that was in the instructions. That rep gave him another number. Then the second rep gave him a third number to call. Then the third rep told him to ""go online"". My Dad is 74; he does not go online. So Sony has been no help. I live far away, so I can't look at the setup myself. I asked him questions, went online to find answers, asked him more questions. Finally figured out one of the problems is that the cable to connect the unit to his television is too large for the TV's line out, which is where it has to connect in order for both of my parents to hear the TV.

TONE_POLARITY,"I received this book from either my mom or my aunt who's quite religious. The authors seem very close-minded. It's a book for someone who is fanatically religious and some of the statements made in the book are a bit ridiculous, mentioning that movies like Harry Potter and Astrology is evil. Also, it's very discriminating against gays, the book gives the idea of homosexuality being unacceptable. There's also a typo on page 165 saying ""You many even feel proud of your new hairy look."" It had a few good points but overall it was so very one-sided. I didn't like it at all.",,0

It's a story of a 14 year old boy, living a cruel existance in a mental hospital and trying to make sense of the insanity of his life and others around him, and the inhumanity he suffers at the hands of those whom a child should be able to trust most.We understand his thinking, we are angry for him, and we want to reach into his nightmare of a life and pull him out. There are no happy endings here, he does not walk off into a fake sunset...but the book is written with an honesty and beauty that is not easily forgotten.

TONE_POLARITY,"Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister. The preview outshines the work itself. I did enjoy reading it, however; Cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. His style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion.",,1

Oh and minus one bass player? Bob Rock stepped up and took care of the bass beautifully. This album shows Metallica going back to their roots, back to the ""Kill em all"" and ""Justice"" days when they were heavier than ever.

When I plugged the kensington firewall into my USB the first computer, the system recognized that a new piece of hardware was installed and then froze up for a few seconds before the blue screen came up and the system crashed.

John Egerton clearly ate his way across the south to write this book, and he was careful to stay well off the beaten path.

This movie goes from bad to worse and then gets even worse. What is this movie about? Is there a point? It made no sense to me, seems to me that it's an Angsty movie about teenage angst, with extra angst and more teenage angst thrown in just to make it more Angsty. I kept trying to find a good spot in this film or at least something that would indicate what was going on, never happened. Apparently the director was smoking 'pregnant guppies' while he was filming, because this movie makes no sense at all, and probably wouldn't get better (even if you smoked a 'pregnant guppy').

TONE_POLARITY,"I had this machine and the 2800 for my small office. Mind you I sent faxes and rarely received them. Even with that I only sent 2 a day. After 4 months the 4800 went and after 5 months the 2800 went. Both times I got intense black lines on the pages I faxed, not knowing until a customer told me and caused embarassment on my end. Nothing could be done to repair it. I was told it was more than likely the drum which sold for more than the fax. End result both in the garbage.Avoid all brother products at all costs. My brother (how ironic) bought a brother laser jet and had a problem after 6 months and also had to toss it. Save your money.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Meaning they are qualified stars. I like the premise of Alien Nation, usually better than I like the actuality, but that's common on series sf TV... The Alien Nation books tend to be better than what we saw on TVs. Besides this one I like, _Body & Soul_ and _Passing Fancy_. All are about what is to be Tenctonese and human, that's an interesting concept to me.The reporter in this one is a not very veiled Harlan Ellison, IMO, and I found that amusing. I also found a copy of _Black Like Me_ at a used bookstore after reading this. Telling _Black Like Me_ in a sf mode is interesting, well done, worth reading if you don't end up paying too much for it.",,1

This is a wonderful love story with, for once, an original concept. It's very well written... I'm surprised this is the author's first book - many of the passages are just so beautifully constructed. Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important. If the reader does not understand some things, it is because the characters don't either; any confusion simply further conveys the essense of Henry's feeling that he has little control over his life, and Clare's fear that she will lose him.",,1

Why because it only delivers one verdict in the area of food safety - that nitrites and nitrates rule - it fails to give the educated consumer a choice in approach. I fail to see how, when amongst many others the acknowledged King of hams in Parma or its moot equal Iberico can deliver such gems without the use of nitrates,the art of charchuterie can be considered complete for dismissing their non use so quickly. Many will deservedly love this book but for the adventurous among us it falls short.",,0

I still think its a great metal album although a bit hokey (especially the cover).

TONE_POLARITY,"Recieved alarm in a ""zip-lock"" baggy. Inside the bag, the alarm had a piece of corrugated cardboard backing and piece of thin red plastic to cover the alarm from dust. The red cover was abraded/torn in two places and the battery compartment was hanging open. Therefore there was little to protect the device from damage. The baggy with the alarm was placed inside an oversized box with inadequate padding as well. They used two strips of AirPlus bagged air pods which were 75% deflated. Thus no real protection... plus the oversized box was crushed and torn open on one corner.

All of the songs seemed to sound the same as the previous ones. But as I listened to it more and more I noticed how good it really is. You have to give it a few listens before you can get into it. This certainly isn't anything like issues or follow the leader, it's more like their first album (except this time around they know what they're doing). There are many hard, heavy and melodic songs like Embrace and Bottled Up Inside, and almost every track has beautiful melody over the chorus. There are still a couple of tracks that I do not like (Make Believe, Beat It Upright & Wake Up Hate), for they lack the melody that makes this cd good. I just think this is by far the best album KoRn has made, but the most hard to get into.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As standard definition tube TV's go Toshiba has put together a nice one here. Picture quality from a basic DirecTV box is decent even when connected via standard coax cable. It is however, when you play a DVD connected through the componet jacks on the rear that the picture really jumps off the screen. The details are generally sharp and the colors are vibrant. (Note: If you are upgrading from a smaller tv that doesn't have a 16:9 mode, you may need to adjust your DVD players output to maximize its benefits. You will still have the black bars at the top and bottom but they occupy significantly less screen area then I have been accustomed to.)I have been largely please with the setup features and overall performance of the set. My one gripe, small as it may seem, is that there is only one set of component jacks on the rear of the set. The second set is in the panel on the front.Bottom line, if you are replacing an older tube tv then this set is worth a look.",,1

Even the material actually devoted to new customer acquisition is remedial. I suspect that the other reviewers are friends of the author. Overall grade: F-.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I love lattes but hate to spend over $3 for one at a coffee shop. I already had an espresso machine without an attached frother so I decided to see if I could find a portable, non electric one on Amazon! Thank you Amazon for leading me to the Aerolatte. I purchased the original one first that I used at home, at work, and at our camper. I then bought the black To Go one to use at home and take to our camper on the weekends. I leave the original at work. My daughter-in-law and sister loved the lattes I made for them so I bought both of them one for Christmas. They love them! Plus, I try to eat healthy most of the time and having a warm latte made with decaf espresso, fat-free milk, sugar-free carmel flavoring for only 90 calories is such a treat and very filling!

TONE_POLARITY,"I should preface this by saying that I love IBM laptops -- I've had several (including the T42 I'm using to write this review) and agree they really are the gold standard for laptops. Although they may lack some of the whiz-bang features of HP and Dell machines, they are bullet proof, and have the best keyboards I've ever used.With that... I'd take a pass on this machine. Lenovo (who accquired IBM thinkpad operations) sells consumer machines that cost a few hundred dollars more than this, but are able to run current operating systems. With the soon to come release of the next version of Windows, this machine won't do. Moreover, it hard drive is small, and would require an upgrade for many applications, such as photos, mp3's, etc. Or, if I really wanted an IBM machine, I'd troll E-bay for more current used machines or factory refurbs.",,0

Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history.

TONE_POLARITY,"I like this book very much. This workbook instructs one how to work through the mathematical requirements of neural networks. By doing so the reader gets a good mathematical background of chaining through the mathematics and seeing the internal structure of many networks. This information is valuable if one is interested in programming your own neural networks. The 5-1/2 floppy disk accompanying the workbook is not usable, at least not to me. If you need to learn and work through the mathematics and chart the results of neural networks that is a great book to start with.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The film, Adventures Of Tartu, is a one of the best WW II British propoganda films. Robert Donet is one of the finest actors of that era. However, the video and audio transfer of the film by Alpha Home Entertainment Studio is terible. The video is dark and the audio is way out of sync (so badly it is unwatchable). I did not return the copy of that DVD because it would have cost more to return it then to keep it. I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon). The Terra Studios copy was of much better quality and is well worth watching. Be careful of the source. It would be nice if Amazon would post Studio specific reviews for DVDs rather then compiling multiple manufactures reviews into all like DVD titles.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I watched ""The Strangers"" on TV, thinking it would be silly and mindless; I had other things to do. I watched and was held to the narrative, and kept thinking this is just another home-invasion, slasher film. I was wrong. Director Bertino put together an attractive cast, and found a sound crew of absolute perfection. This is psychological horror done quite well, without the blood and gore. It also helps that Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman handled their roles very well. It may have moved a little too slowly, and the 911 call at the beginning doesn't make sense, but it's a truly scary film. The final scene, with the Jesus freak kids, was clever. Not to be totally written off.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The album is very good. Lots of varying styles and good honest acoustic guitar playing. But, with Howe and Martin on the same album, it should have been better.

That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale.

They were out of step with the early 70s progressive rock movement...but pre-dated the rock revival and glam rock scene by several years.This reissue of their first album (plus bonus tracks) is a long overdue gem. The songs are all catchy and riff laden mini-masterpieces.

From a complete beginner, to someone with limited experience looking to improve the paddling experience, increase safety and basically have more fun, this video touches on all the little bits of information that are necessary, but that could take a lifetime to learn on ones own.

Oh yeah, multiple assassins around every corner. A brilliant concept almost completely ruined by too much action and too many characters. It becomes completely overwhelming when the dream within a dream, within a dream, within a dream, culminates in some sort of ""Ice Station Zebra(esque)"" nonsense. JEEZ--the audience needs a breather!DiCaprio's talents are completely wasted. The subplot with the dead wife was strangely reminiscent and done much better in ""Shutter Island."" Gordon-Levitt was miscast(way too young for the part).

TONE_POLARITY,Artwork has nothing to do with the book. I create all the picturs in my mind anyway. If I want to buy a book for pictures I'll buy a comic book. This book however was great. In the large elaborate world of this series a guide is almost a necessity. I know it takes from some of the intrigue of the book. But there are so many characters that directly relate to the plot that I think some of the facts covered in this book will never see print in the series. I highly recommend this to all true fans. I have read the series almost as many times as there are book in the series. Maybe even more. I am unsure. But I still like the information presented here. Artwork is never as good as the pictures in my head anyway.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Karate Kid part 3 fails on many levels. The first movie had an innocence to it. Ater that movie, the innocence was lost. Ralph Macchio looks too old for this film. He's a talented actor but when you're 30 something , there's only so much that make-up can hide. The obsession that the old sensai from Karate Kid part 1 and the millionaire had with Daniel's title was disturbing. I also doubt that he went to Vietnam because he looked like he was in his late 20's. They should have switched roles...the milloinaire could pass for the karate kid and Ralph Macchio (with a little makeup) could have passed for a middle aged Vietnam vet.The plot is predictable as well...if you're paying attention, you'll have an idea of what's going to happen.

It is one of those books that lament the advent of mass tourism and infrastructure development, and I suppose these inevitable changes deserve lamenting in several senses, but other writers have done it so much better. Maybe the first and last chapters could be recommended but the rest is boring. None of the characters come alive and none of the real issues they face are made as clear as they should be.

Unfortunately, some of the songs are a little odd, but when it comes to ""Broadway"" songs, along with ""Who Will Love Me..."", ""I Will Never Leave You"" is powerful and beautiful. These two women better have another theatre vehicle soon! It would be such a waste if they don't work on another show together. The other cd's which they've released are on my list for my birthday. I know that I won't be disappointed. Too bad the show wasn't given the chance that it deserved.",,1

It was sent in the middle of winter (a Christmas gift from my mom and dad I might add)But it was still hadn't droped it's leaves. It was poorly potted, like they were going for a root over rock style with out the rock.the top was cut off and it had 2 leading shoots. Needeles to say it it held on to it's needles all winter and never really went through a dormant peroied. It finaly droped it's dry as bones leaves near the end of winter but then spring came and it strugled and tried to bud out but failed and is dead very dead...I checked. This was the worst attempt at a bonsai I have ever seen, for this type of tree I could not think of a worse specimen then the one this company (and I use the term companay loosly) sent me.

The routine is extremely boring and the guy in the video is mostly ignored by Kathy. I feel bad for him. Whenever he says anything she seems uncomfortable and just keep going without paying attention to him at all. And as he is shorter than her they look so funny. This really seems a sketch of a bad comedy or something. There are plenty of much better balance ball workouts out there.

The widescreen format is especially important to convey the unique sense of tension only David Lynch can achieve- through directing,lighting and set design.

TONE_POLARITY,"About thirty years ago I read the great book on hypnosis by Lewis Wolberg [Hypnosis, Is It For You?] and thought I knew just about everthing on the subject. Shortly afterwards I read Kreskin's book and he took the whole subject a giant leap forward. This is especially interesting as Kreskin says there's no such thing as hypnosis! Sound strange? The solution to this paradox is one of the reasons this book is so worth reading. When a book stays in your mind for thirty years, that's some indication of it's quality.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I thought that this was a very entertaining book.

TONE_POLARITY,"This was a hard book to put down once I'd started. The story has a stranded Canadian sailor, John McLennan, as its main character, whose life is saved by the Chukchi. During his becoming adapted to their way of life and marrying among them, he finds the English language useful in communicating with and warding off occasional scientific explorers and other adventurers, who find these inhabitants and their land of Wrangel Island off Siberia tempting prey for get-rich schemers. The full range of lean and prosperous seasons in the stark, isolated landscape circa 1910 to 1917 is heartbreaking and joyous in turns. The reader will find plenty of walrus and nerpa and other sea animals and their usefulness to wonder at. The flavor of the this slice of life comes through too from the translator's leaving in some authentic everyday words, whose meaning is immediately appararent from the context or the aid right at the bottom of the page.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The style of the author is like listening to a person that likes to talk about himself all the time. Kinda reminds me of the 1980 movie ""Airplane"" when the ex-fighter pilot tells the story of his life to the passengers; they end their lives in different ways after having to hear him...There are no issues if you planned on finding one. There is no summary and never any conclusion to the issue of racism. It is an amusing story of a 36 year old that has dillidallied in the fight for Black Power. His talk about racism is not scientific nor scholar but simply comes across as to what he's heard. Just alot of personal events that make you dizzy in trying to remember that the author indeed has a point to tell after all the irrelevant details of his story come in pages after pages of paper product.Amusing, yes, informative, no. I cant see either Whites or Blacks reading this and taking him seriously. So who's left? Nah, us Latinos just nod our heads...",,0

I had ordered it in hopes of getting something with a little more musically quality in it, and I guess I'm just dissapointed that it didn't have any discernable songs. However, I think this CD is amazingly funny, and it's really just something anyone could put on as background music and be entertained for the half hour it runs.

They have been left in the weather, brought along on vacations, used hard and are still kicking, which is a lot more than I can say for most toys that have been through our household.After 3 years of hard use, they are still in pretty good shape.

It fell off her bed onto a carpeted floor and the binding broke completely. Since it was made in China, it's not too surprising. If a publisher is going to sell a large heavy reference book aimed at children, they should make the binding heavy-duty for expected hard use. From what the other reviewers said about the dictionary's content, I guess we didn't miss much. Next time we buy a book like this, we'll try to check where it is made first.In summary, don't buy this dictionary for a child since it's content is inadequate and its binding is junk.",,0

However, the book is sometimes confusingly organized and Irving's use of the present tense when describing past events can be irritating and seem a bit amaturish in so seasoned a writer.With these caveats in mind, this is still an important book and necessary reading for any student of World War II. Mr. Irving is neither a Holocaust denier nor a proponent of the Nazis or their ideology; he simply has a different point of view. It's amazing how vociferous and censorious the academic history establishment can become when their 'established' truths are challenged; and in this book, Mr. Irving has done just that.",,1

It has the sound of the old Fear Factory singing but, it has a sound of being slower and more whiny, which is how 90% of bands are sounding than they did back in the 80s (not 80s music, 80s metal). If anyone is a Metal fan knows that Metal is not whiny it's like ""I'll kill you"" then apologizes about it later.

""Lady Gaga: One Sequin at a Time"" provides a rudimentary once-over of Lady Gaga's childhood and the beginning of her career, all the way to (vaguely) the release of The Fame Monster.

Worst of all? They couldn't afford the rights to her music, so instead they opened up GarageBand and created generic electronica tracks that sound just enough like Just Dance and Poker Face to be recognizable, but just off enough to avoid paying royalties.

TONE_POLARITY,Some reviewers call this album experimental. The only thing experimental about it is how much offensive noise one can produce using latest technology in sound recordings.

TONE_POLARITY,"Even after reading great reviews of this vacuum we were surprised how much we liked it: Amply powered, with a decent sized dirt cavity, the low price is pretty unbelievable. All in all it's a great deal but I have two complaints: I would have preferred a brush attachment on the little hose end but the real disappointment is the non retractable cord. It has to be wound up to store then unwound to use every time and that's a time gobbling design flaw.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Honestly? P.U.despite being a huge Cary Grant fan, I can't buy him in this role. both the character (selfless gynecologist to the down-trodden, amateur orchestra conductor, sensitive soul, all 'round renaissance man) and grant's performance (all over the map) are far too precious to be taken seriously. or even comically. which may be the problem w/ the film: the odd mixture of satire, moralizing, and cautionary anti-mccarthy tale just doesn't hang together well.I'd write this off as yet another retread of hollywood's ham-handed self-congratulatory liberalism. if you're looking for vintage mank, stick w/ ""all about eve;"" for classic cary, ""north by northwest.""",,0

Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages.",,0

What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.)

However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying this album, although forever lost are the hints of metallica and megadeth. The songs still retain their classic Sum 41 catchiness and the great presentation of awesome lyrics (on most of the songs, anyway).",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"My husband knew I was looking for a non-stick muffin pan and kindly bought this for me. I happily made a batch of muffins and put the batter directly into the pan, thinking how great it was going to be to skip the step where I butter the pan. The muffins stuck badly to the pan. They stuck to this pan worse than they would have stuck to the fine old Ekco muffin pan I've been using for years. I have just read through the other reviews of this item and was amazed to see people are highly impressed by a pan that they must first grease before putting in the muffin batter. Folks, this has been true of all muffin pans for as long as I've been alive, and that's a very long time. Other than that aspect, this pan is almost as good as my old Ekco pan.",,0

Matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of Moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. It is also informed and inspired by Moroccan design, which combines Mediterranean and Islamic elements to beautiful effect.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"When I bought this album a few months back in a local store in Boston, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know much of L'Arc~en~ciel's early work, but, I decided to take a chance.After listening to it a couple times, I decided it was okay. But, it grew on me, and now, its one of my favorite albums (I don't have many CDs anyways, but that's beyond the point).My favorite songs off the albums are In The Air (Hyde's voice makes me go all bubbly-fangirly, and the bassline is awesome), And She Said, Caress of Venus, and Winter Fall.If you are a fan of L'Arc~en~ciel, I definately reccommend getting this album.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"We intend to use this periscope inside a toy cardboard house we built for the kids. The plan is to bore a hole in the middle to place the periscope so they can see outside from inside the box. Sounds fun? Not exactly. The view is too small. When you look into it, you can only see an area the size of a single face in it. They should make this wide angle view. It is too hard to find and see anything, like looking for a tiny airplane up in the sky using a peephole. Not really worth it.Construction is fine. It is a piece of telescoping plastic pipe than extends to 14"". But at least it would help if it is more functional than this.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I am a very big fan of Alanis's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album because it didnt get much airplay and it wasnt overplayed like many songs off of Jagged Little Pill. This album ranks higher than both of these...even the overplayed songs sound good. This CD is one of the best of all time in my opinion, I do wish she included some more songs off of Junkie, though. No Pressure Over Cappucino, Joining You, and Princes Familiar are by far the best songs on the album. The live versions of You Learn and That I Would Be Good are also good because they are stripped of their fake drum beats. I would reccommend this album to anyone who is a fan of acoustic music.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The opening track's a gem - once heard, never forgotten, and probably danced to. Has the stamp of blues standard all over it, in a rollicking Jimmy Reed sort of way. Over Nevada is a real rarity - try finding it anywhere else - and it's fab. Like a long lost Patti Page single, and a good one. Anders Osborne's track is quite tasty, and the rest is less memorable but always at least pleasant. As a whole, it hangs together very well as a rootsier package than the movie would suggest.",,1

Keep in mind....if you buy the red ones they transfer color like crazy! They make your socks red and then if you put on a different pair of shoes the color will come off those socks and stain the insides of the other shoes. They even come with a warning inside the box that says the color will transfer easily. I wouldn't buy the red again but they are gorgeous.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I was very excited to read this book when I bought it, but, when I got to the 150/something page, I gave up, because I lost interest instantly after a series of boring issues. 1- The story is not fast paced at all, apparently he loves to write the following a lot, he himself-they themselves-A LOT!!, the protagonist, being the man in the situation, acts so stupid, as to sit around and do nothing when peoples is getting killed by his decisions. Even getting to the point to saying, ""waste the bitch"" as signal to the way one was getting killed. Toooo descriptive that gets boring. In general this could have been a kick ass book, taking out the stupidity and inaction for the main character, making him more ferocious, not talking too much non sense, and by keeping a pace well stated. By the way, I gave away the book, with the book-marker in it, marking my give up point...",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Uncommon Carriers is an uncommon book, but then that is what one should expect from John McPhee. This is the third of his books that I have read, and all have been rather quirky. In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. He does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. The up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blasé to those not in the industry. The down side is that McPhee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. Because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others. But all are fascinating and eye-opening.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This CD is neither horrible nor sublime. Just...OK. Mediocre. It's competent, but it has no lasting hold. The listenere coming to this CD looking for a great jazz CD will be sorely disappointed. Naylor obviously has a wonderful voice, smoky and sultry, and the musicianship throughout is quite good. And yet, there's something a little soulless about it all. The lyrics, while intending to be heartfelt and confessional, sound not unlike the heartfelt confessions of someone else--Sarah McLaughlin, Toni Childs, Jane Siberry, even Joni Mitchell. Nothing truly insightful or distinctive, beyond that wonderful voice. Which is a shame, because there's nothing ""wrong"" here, but it all ends up as so much melancholy cotton candy.I do think it's telling that the vast majority of the reviews below begin with raves about her live performances. Perhaps that's the way to see Naylor, with a drink in hand and a freshly broken heart.",,0

There are no times listed in the descriptions so the buyer is unaware of whether this is a full or cut version of the movie. The current online store (Amazon) does not list the length of the movie. Therefore, how do I know which version I am getting? Do I buy another one and pay the shipping to return it?

Generally, I am happier with Szell conducting Mozart or Dave Goulder singing about following along as his dad plowed the fields.

The arrangements are basic, but perfect. And that voice! Man, Howard Tate is right along side Otis, Aretha, Ray Charles and Bobby Bland! It's no so much that they sing well, though they do of course! They convince you! You BELIEVE them the same way you believe Townes Van Zandt or Hank Williams! Listen to ""Glad I Knew Better"". This is testimony!

However it has a fatal flaw: a complete lack of durability. in one year in Thailand and traveling, I broke three kindles; each time, Amazon sent a replacement, and a family member who happened to be visiting brought it along. I finally just broke my fourth kindle, and am out of warranty.I may be especially hard on my kindle- travel tends to be difficult- but travel is precisely when I need it. My macbook has lasted 6 years, my iphone has lasted roughly 4 times my average kindle's lifespan,and now, I am going to have to purchase something more durable. this product was a huge disappointment because its promise was so great, because it's so laughably fragile.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"...A Prayer For Owen Meany was a transcendental experience as anovel. Yes, this movie needs to be taken on its own terms as aseparate entity, and in doing so, it is a decidedly mixed bag. The character of Simon Birch rips your heart out not because of the weak and soppy screenplay, but because the small actor playing him is so frail looking and sad as a human being. This movie is shameless in its use of him, and successfully garners some lumps in the throat as the movie soppily explores one of the least interesting episodes from the novel. The character of Joe is given way too much emphasis in this version; everything seems calculated and designed to pull your heartstrings. Though there are a few genuine laughs (which come directly from John Irving's skewed life-view as set in the novel), this movie lambasts you with way too much autumnal color and weepy, bombastic music swelling on the soundtrack. Forgettable. END",,0

It's nothing more than a big budget slasher movie that borders on the pornographic. How respectable actors like Jude Law and Forest Whitaker can involve themselves in such dreck is beyond me. How this project was ever greenlighted is equally unfathomable. There may have been some dark humor to be mined by the film's dubious premise but as executed here it's just unpleasant. Do yourself a favor and avoid this sadistic exercise. Poking hot needles in your eyes would be more worth your while.,,0

This makes the watch very difficult to read without a direct light source or the backlight on.Other than that here are some good points:-well designed interface-well builtA few minor faults:-unit runs a little fast (gains about 30 seconds/month, i.e. gains about 1 second per day)-the design of the band/case is somewhat blandOverall conclusion: I recommend this watch.",,1

Don't expect classical fireworks, just simple relaxing melodies played beautifully with great sensitivity. The more modern items are, to me at any rate, not so pleasing as Florante's interpretation of the older melodies and traditional music, very little of which is known outside of the Philippines. With his consumate musicianship and most attractive demeanour Florante makes a fine ambassador for the music of his homeland, and deserves to be known much better outside the Philippines.",,1

With hooks so smart, if I were a fish I wouldn't mind losing my life to hooks like that. I would snap on. I would take the bait. They could reel me in.Axes is starker, and more Stockhausen, which is always popular with modern minds, not always mine. It's what John Cale's Paris 1919 should have sounded like, and was so disapointing and boring because it didn't. And it's a lot like that final, two-album leap that Talk Talk made when they transcended everything, when they abandoned pop for good and went free. I hope Electrelane stick around though.",,1

(And he hasn't changed much, check out his ""Journey to the Darkside..."")Nugent claims he didn't know the songs were about drugs... does anyone believe that for a minute?This disc is missing some notable songs, including ""Surrender To Your Kings"" and ""Inside the Outside"". Also, for no good reason, this version of ""Prodigal Man"" has been remixed, with instrumental passages out of their original order.

He really dropped the ball in this novel, as did his editor who allowed all of the parenthetical asides that interrupted any flow he might have established in the narrative. The characters were vapid and unappealing, so unlike the persons of depth readers usually find. The plot was contrived and tedious. It was always a pleaure to learn from Bohjalian's work about a subject totally unfamiliar and surprisingly interesting, like midwifery or alternative medicine or transexuality. The FERAL people were consistently annoying and extreme to a fault. Their abrasive stance made Spencer's ""accident"" seem a just dessert for someone so narrow- minded and controlling.

It is not hard to discern why this book, as insignificant as it is, has been lauded by the press and Hollywood. It caters to sympathies that the press and Hollywood universally suscribe to without a search for greater truths or real meaning. Additionally, the writer creates no sense of urgency or intrigue for the reader. It is the equivalent of watching a soap opera in which the writers are trying their best to write like Shakespeare.",,0

Also, the Apple Loaf cake was really sweet, dense, and mushy (had to bake it forever) and very fattening. I have not tried all the recipes but it seems this book is too inconsistent. Another problem is, some of the ingredients are not easily found at your local grocery store. So you need to either order them online or schlepp to Whole Foods.

I would not recommend this pump combo to anyone unless your legs need a workout from pushing your ride around.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie. The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis. The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues. It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements. The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme. The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant ""Russian element,"" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst. The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"we love the original totoro and did not realize that this new version had been so disney-fied. it borders on sacrelige for those of us that love totoro. the voices are too harsh and loud, the music and singing at the beginning is harsh and loud. we could only watch about ten minutes of it and are currently looking for a copy of the original movie. it was a very dissapointing experience.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"For anyone who has ever wondered what Shakespeare would be writing, were he alive today; look no further than the films of Kevin Smith. Whitty Dialogue, intricate story lines, characters with depth, and baudy humor (to satisfy the rabble in the pit; we smell our own)are the hallmark of his films. This film, the first of what fans have dubbed 'The Jersey Trilogy', is a decent debut for Smith, but the movie drags ever-so-slightly in the middle. It is, however, by no means is a disappointment. The new DVD release comes packed with features and is a ""must have"" for the hardcore fan.",,1

In the first chapter, Mandie's father dies and her stepmother is cruel to her. So, her dear indian friend, Uncle Ned leads her to her uncle John's mansion where she discovers a tunnel built by her great-grandfather in order to hide the Cherokees when they were being driven out of their land by the whites. Also she is reunited with her real mother, who marries Mandie's uncle John.This great story will keep you on the edge of your seat and not want to put it down.

TONE_POLARITY,I read all the various reviews of the film and some people are labeling it propaganda and attacking other's views. Well I have a negative review too!How can anyone put together such a great cast of actors and turn out such a stupid film. My views on homosexuality are very conservative but that is not the point. The film is very amusing at first but it ends up being just a pointless drama at the end. I mean the comedy just stopped and I felt cheated out of a film that could have been truly great if it kept up the comedy.Movies don't have to be so preachy. Especially when their comedies.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I received this speaker system for my birthday many years ago and it still hits very hard after having gone through years of abuse. I love my bass-hitting music and even turn it up so that I can hear my music from my bedroom while I'm in the shower. The bass has been blasted so loud with bass-test songs that shelves have emptied themselves all over my floor as well as multiple drinks having fallen off of my desk. This system located upstairs on the second floor makes the support columns located outside of my house by the front door vibrate when it is at 3/4 volume with bass all the way up. This is by far worth the 100$ and I was surprised to find out it has 200w RMS. I had been thinking it was atleast 500w RMS.GREAT BUY!

TONE_POLARITY,"To suggest these works well or even moderately well written is to confuse the issues we have judged to be important in good writing. Burkowski has an obvious gift for crafting fine sentences, and to construct tales directly from life experience or perceived life experience is a beautiful thing, but not to spend even a moment making any sense of or trying to understand these experiences proves a true lack of insight. Semi-literate six year olds, lost in a chaotic twirl of inchoate thoughts and ramblings are capable of the same. All of this is not even to mention the trite, ridiculous heart that palps pitifully within each of these ill-considered works. Literature is more than this! For those who believe there is genuine meaning in organized human expression for the sake of communication, please do not be midlead by these silly stories.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"simply put, this is an ambient version of ""cassette"".. but that is a good thing, because SND are positioning themselves slightly towards a larger audience by making their sound a little (just a little!) more friendly and less monotonous. Imagine ""cassette"" with almost no kick drums, some pads (!) and some trace melodies. The second half is just fantastic. If you put that together with the best tracks of ""cassette"", then you would have one hell of an album.its worth checking out if their last album caught your ear..",,1

I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I honestly did not know what I was getting myself into when I bought this CD. I love Janacek, I love folk songs... how could I go wrong? Iva Bittova! I was concerned that she would have a 50yr old woobly voice, but instead what exists is a thin VERY nasal tone... perhaps she should be singing traditional Bulgarian music! The voice is expressive, just ugly.The recording quality is not very good, either. On many of the tracks, Iva seems to be muffled and in the background of the recording.Really - dont waste your time and money, unless you really would just like to have a recording of over 50 Janacek songs.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I admit that I didn't read the previous reviews, and snatched this up on the spur of the moment with another item I'd ordered. I was attracted by the price and by the apparent completeness of the earliest of Dragnet episodes. I'm puzzled by the omission of the Dragnet theme, so iconic that without it, the shows seem very flat. I'm disappointed at the video quality as well, as if these are copied from a well worn film rather than the masters. Overall, for the cheap price, I guess one can't expect too much.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Installed backup pump per instructions 2 months ago. Tested the backup pump by unplugging main pump and filling sump pit with garden hose. Everything worked fine and gave me a peace of mind that I no longer need to worry about power outages when I'm gone. I went down today to check battery level and that checked okay. It was raining this morning so I had a chance to see main (Zoeller 57) pump cycle on. That's when I notice water shooting out the bottom of the backup pump. It told me the cheap, garbage, mini check that Zoeller uses on their backup pump failed. I should have followed advice and my instincts to remove their check and use a better check in the system.Zoeller should be ashamed that they compromise what would be a good product had they spent a couple bucks more on a better check.I now have to remove the whole system and rebuild it.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a very sweet story about a time, place, and man that was the construct of the author of this book. Historians and philosophers will continue to debate whether Lao Tzu ever existed or, if the Tao Te Ching was the work of many men. This book, however, portrays a decidedly Judeo/Christian perspective to the man called Lao Tzu and his life and times. The book is inacurate in it's portayal of life and philosophy/religion during the Han Dynasty. The author clearly misrepresents the history and beliefs in ancient China in a desire to mold Chinese thinking into a monotheistic belief system. If the reader is willing to set aside the historical and philosophical truths of the Chineses culture, the story is set forth as a very sweet parable.

A woman is made of paper while her creature is left with multiple paper cuts all over his hands. A baby Nostradamus is born. A man loses his lime eating wife because he can't stop wetting the bed, and decides to travel to America with his daughter who attracts the attention of a carnation picker.

And if you are a Jew, and perhaps even if you are not, you will be offended by translator notes including gems such as ""the tragedies that befell the Jews were the fulfillment of prophecy -- punishment for the murderers of our saviour.""Amazon, please remove this volume.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Lastima que la linea de la pelicula no siga en nada a la linea del libro. no tiene que ser una interpretacion textual o algo parecido, pero al menos una adaptacion que respete situaciones claves como el espiritu de Jonathan Kent, o a la Liga de la Justicia en el funeral o incluso la misma imagen de Luthor, sin mencionar la estupidez de que Luisa Lane este enamorada de Superman y de Khal-El y no de Clark Kent. Vamos Warner y DC Comics, un poquito de respeto a la inteligencia de sus lectores. A pesar de todo, la animacion y la brutalidad de Doomsday fueron muy bien hechos. Lastima la pobreza de la historia.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"In addition to what David wrote above, the book has no colour photos (other than in the covers) and even the historical photos aren't that many.Most of it consists of close up shots of museum and private collection exhibits. Lack of drawings is a serious disadvantage and I still don't understand why South Lebanese Army and Ugandan tanks were not covered (they were Israeli sourced and saw combat service) when Chilean Shermans get an entire chapter. To sum up, save your money for the Lioness and Lion of the Line series and leave Gannon's book to the collectors.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Okay, first I don't have blu-ray. I refuse to go to yet ANOTHER video format. But I wanted a DVD of the new transfer of A&C MEET FRANKY with the correct logos (the last DVD had Realart Titles). So I bought this set as I knew the blu-ray was correct. So what did Universal do for the DVD disc? They stuck in the old Comedy Legends disc from 2000. A transfer from the dupe 35mm fine grain with plenty of white dirt and a bad audio ""fix"" in the main title (a trumpet riff repeats annoyingly). My question is, why BOTHER to put two discs in this set if one of them isn't going to be of the new transfer? Phooey. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure the blu-ray disc is great and if that's what you're after I can recommend it blindly. But if you want the latest transfer on DVD, it ain't here.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Sugar Ray was good at one time. RPM was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. Although the CD is okay, it's too poppy for me. The best treat is by far the song ""Stay On"" with Nick Hexum, frontman of the band 311. Many people fail to realize Hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. Overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.Music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This novel was written in 1889 and set in 1863 in a Sicilian fishing village within walking distance of Verga's native Catania. My paternal great-grandparents spent their lives in a similar village on the northern coast of Sicily. Reading this novel brought back my Grandmother's voice telling stories of the fishermen with variations on the proverbs, superstitions, Catholicism and village gossip of Verga. In Verga's novel, ownership of the house is lost through payment of a debt to preserve the Malavoglia's family honor. In my family, the two fishing boats were sold to protect the family honor from a false accusation. In the Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel, Verga is written about extensively in a chapter about realism. This book is a delightful validation of social history in post-unification Sicily. These peasants were hard-workers whose family and religion gave meaning to their lives.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I agree with the other reviewer. I bought all of the books in this series and am shocked at how much of the advice has been taken from previous authors on these topics.

If you want to know how to do things ""correctly"", read Letitia Baldridge's ""The New Manners For the '90's"". It covers everything and is written by a woman with the education and experience to know of which she speaks! Not someone who using her fashion connections to flood the magazines and talk shows with her ""discovery"" of this information.",,0

And don't let the blurb about Christian painter mislead you, Hilary Jackson's art is Christian-themed but the story isn't. The Art of Dying is a mystery, a well-crafted mystery about art and murder.Set in the richly described Northern California village of Steeple Hill, author Diana Killian has put together a book with the elements of a cozy mystery; an innocent observer turned sleuth, a small community of artists, murder without graphic scenes of violence, and yep, even a cat - and the elements of romantic suspense; an attractive British man with amnesia, a kind-hearted young woman who cares for him, a dead Scotland Yard Inspector, lingering doubts about altruism or love, and the question of being mislead by someone who may be a victim or a villain.

In ""Batman"" there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.",,1

""Wanted:Dead or Alive"" is worth listening to if simply to hear Sambora's sick guitar intro. Unfortunately the second half of the album collapses under its own hair gel. Theres a couple more rockers but mostly ballads so sappy they make Sammy Hagar look like a die hard cynic.

I took one star off of this album because at a few points on the album he doesn't make any sense, and at other points he rehashes some old schticks we've all heard before. The good thing is that he does branch out on this album and performs a couple of comedy songs which are really different from the song on Raw Hamburger.

He is clearly having a good time, but his enthusiasm exceeds his talent.

The massage is poor, and does not even go up to my shoulder blades, so misses the entire top of my back. I don't know if I got a dud or if it is just not as good as I anticipated.

TONE_POLARITY,"How about keeping Dexter on the air ?I've always believed the writer and director's of this television show to have mastered the continuous plot needed in each episode to hold the interest of the viewers. We all know what's going to take place with each episode yet the fun is in the watching as Dexter is his third party narrative, and his planning to kidnap the bad guy so he can continuously establish within himself, his love affair with mayhem. All of the episodes of all the seasons are great. Some episodes are better than others depending on the plot. Dexter as a whole is great. If you're a nut case stay away from Dexter. But then I should say stay away from Seinfeld if you're a nut case. Come on Showtime keep Dexter around. It is good entertainment even though it's based upon mayhem.",,1

Her performance is so rivetting that I was even saying to myself ""I believe you, Jen. I do believe you!"" Every Thanksgiving I watch this film, I don't know why, it's just the perfect time for it.

For someone who played defense in college and specializes in defense at the collegiate coaching level, the book is helpful if one-sided. The Italians focus on a zonal defense, and in general flat-back defense is detailed. There is some very good stuff in here to help build a defense. Additionally, almost any formation you can imagine is given a quick glance by a professional coach who uses it and notes its advantages and disadvantages.

But when I actually had to use the PDA, the cover just got in the way too much, and became a big annoyance.The front cover for this case flips down. So when you want to access the PDA, you have two ways of holding it. One is with the cover dangling at the bottom of your device, banging into your palm. The other way is to fold the cover into the back, which is even worse since now the sharp inner edges are striking your palm, making using the PDA for a long time very uncomfortable if not unfeasible.The cutouts are also not very precise.

Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be a takeoff of Edwin Lansdale, the model for William Lederer's ""The Ugly American,"" a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel. Today Alden Pyle could be seen as a character based on the Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, Henry Cabot Lodge or Robert Komer of the 1960s. Greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I was very disappointed as this book contains no herbal formulas. There are a few formulas for cosmetics and aromatherapy but not for the herbs. It has some useful information regarding the uses of a large number of herbs but without the measurements to mix the formulas it can not be true to the title.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,I think this book is great! I recently read it for my college children's literature class. I think she did a great job of developing the characters and really made you feel like you were living in their shoes. I think it is very educational for children to learn about what African Americans went through in the south during that time period! I'm very glad she won the Newbery Award in 1977. She deserved it!!!!!,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I found the idea of an American male attempting to write a companion novel to Mrs. Dalloway, in the style of Virginia Woolf, quite presumptuous. Needless to say I was extremely sceptical. After reading The Hours, I must say it was beautifully executed. Although this is not a sequel of a classic and does stand alone, anyone wanting to read this should read Mrs. Dalloway first to appreciate all the nuances and subtle referrences.

The only scenes with Bruce are some third rate snipets from Return of the dragon that have nothing to do with The true game of death movie. The best way to describe this movie is that they tried to remake The game of death In which Bruce Lee does actually appear for those few fight scenes that he is in.

The cinematography is something I would have expected from my high school students, if this were still the year 1980. The story line could have been stronger.

Needless to say this has been very annoying and I have to make sure either the fan isn't plugged in when I don't want to use it OR that I don't use the remote anywhere near the Fan anymore when I am using the TV remote.

This story about a May/December love mismatch has potential, but the writer/director put way too many barriers in the way - besides the age difference there's also a language barrier and a different-career barrier (he's a budding violinist, she stays home and gardens). Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. And why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? Why add the pretense of danger (Oh no! They might be German spies!) if you aren't going to do anything with it? This story couldn't really decide where it wanted to go so it meandered around for a while and ended up going nowhere.",,0

The only thing this movie had in common with the actual story were the names of the characters. I don't think Jane Austen herself would have recognized her story. I guess that's what ""based on the novel by Jane Austen"" means. Very loosely based. This rendition had no soul and the only clever thing about this movie was the end.",,0

But after a while, the heartfelt nature with which he paid tribute to Dr. King, the barely-boiling-over anger of Global Empire, the ode to true love in Ballad for My One True Love and the sighing loss of Train Leaving Gray seemed to pinpoint not only the struggles that Mason seemed to be facing as a songwriter but the same struggles that most of humanity faces in one form or another.",,1

I am (was) a fan of the Washington Redskins and I am a huge NASCAR fan so naturally I was attacted to this book by Joe Gibbs.I do not mean to say that his hypothesis is incorrect (trust in God) but a 300 page book that states the same thing over and over???Don't bother with this book unless you need reinforcement that God is the way of life. But if that is your passion, you should already be following in His footsteps so there should be no need for this book.

But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined.

We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Recon Scout by Fred Salter is an excellent read! This is a first hand account by an individual that is a self-proclaimed ""maverick"" in his approach to life. He served in WWII as a scout for invasion forces in North Africa and Europe. His first-hand experiences are captured here from the perspective of the guy in the trenches, not from the perspective of a professional novel writer. He shares both the experiences, and emotions, of battle and the hardships associated with living on the battlefield in a life and death situation for extended times. A 'must read' for anyone interested in the history of warfare in general, and WWII in particular.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The Bridge is like Pipe Dreams to the tenth power. Although it is a completely different story, Solomon has a way of grabbing you by the hand and walking you through a world unlike your own. Both books kept your attention with the right-in-your-face action which made the book a definite page turner. I immediately felt the pain of the characters, and what emotions they were going through without being side tracked from the story. The ending was a true shocker and it will have even the most avid reader stunned. Solomon Jones is bringing something to the table that the average reader isn&#65533;t quite ready for. Writers beware; there is a new man on the block, and he&#65533;s about to take us by storm. Bravo, Solomon!

A couple of the reviews below make me wonder if somebody's working out a personal grudge...Anyway, Toreador is a solid, uptempo, melodic indie rock album by one of the many creative Northwest bands to find themselves trapped at the tail end of the ""grunge"" era. Songs like ""Comet"" and ""Shiva"" are fun, frenetic numbers with a sardonic undertone. One of the best albums of all time? No, of course not. But a good reminder that the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s spawned a lot of quality bands that shouldn't be folded into some one-dimensional ""grunge scene.""

The start of the DVD she goes through each dance combination step by step. Basically you can just keep rewinding and playing back until you get it. When doing the main workout she doesn't call out the next step or instruction - therefore you need to have spend the time learning the routines.The routines do take some time to learn, but with repetitions you will get them down pat.

The Emersons bring to this music, as they bring to Beethoven, Shostakovich, Webern, and Bartók (or anything else they touch), a quality in which they really do exceed the possible sum of their parts: impeccable technical skills, agile intelligence, warm heart, infectious energy, and a breathtaking sense of ensemble.

""Dangerous Ground"" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by. The highlight of this LP is ""What A Feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass. ""Love L.O.D."" featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession.

TONE_POLARITY,"The story of Lindbergh's unusual (strange) childhood and his courageous flight across the Atlantic were gripping. But overall Berg's biography of Lindbergh is a big BORE. So much nitty gritty detail....with no substance. Berg never gets to the heart of this man. In fact, Berg's portrayal of Lindbergh makes me wonder whether Lindbergh HAD a heart. He seemed oblivious to the horrors of Nazism and he appeared indifferent to his family. (So indifferent in fact that I now wonder whether Lindbergh could have been behind his son's disappearance and murder.)",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have recently purchased this tool for professional carpentry applications. It has been used for a week, with no problems and not one single misfire. The battery fits snugly and tight, the fuel cell issues must be resolved,no problems. Very light tool, angle allows access to hard to reach places. The adjustable depth is an excellent addition to the original guns which did not have depth adjustment.I own the Paslode straight nailer and the 18 gauge nailer for trim and we have two Paslode framers.We also use pneumatic tools and trimmers and these Paslodes are not the best alternative for heavy production jobs.

The characters are boring, the plot is simplistic, and there's far too much pointless profanity. Jeff Bridges' character is an idiot and a loser, and somehow we're supposed to identify with him and the trouble he gets himself into.Thinking back, I realize that most of the rave reviews I heard of this movie came in my college days, and not coincidentally, most people I knew back then were a lot like Bridges' character- losers, drug users, drop-outs, and drifters.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a flimsy little cutter. The ruler is in the wrong direction- instead of being across the top it goes down the side, parallel to the cut. So say if you want to trim a picture to 8""x 10"" you have to measure it and mark it first, then trim it. You don't really see exactly where the cut is going to be once you lower the arm, and since the cutter is so flimsy the pictures tend to move or slide out of the way once you lower the arm. It takes 2 people to be able to use it semi-smoothly. I will probably move to a different type of cutter. For small infrequent jobs it will do ok, but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who wants it for higher volume.

It has so many types of toys attached to it and different sound options, it's great. The tray that is removeable is actually one of his favorite parts. He takes it out every time and loves hitting it against the other parts, or just holds it in his hand as he moves around. Funny how the slimpliest things are the best fun for babies.It does take up a fair amount of space, so be prepared if you're limited in that area.

The company calls these ""Universal"" magazines. They are used in Thompson .22-caliber guns as well as a number of others."" Unfortunately, the Thompson in .22LR is no longer being made. Hence the 30-round magazine are no longer made as well. And without a magazine, a machine pistol becomes a single shot weapon. So the design in the book is basically outdated right out of the gate.

Wow! 1000 recipes! I looked in the index and the names of the dishes really did inspire me to believe they would be exquisite. They are the most bland tasting dishes I have EVER eaten in my life. Spices do exist (and I don't mean salt), anyone can throw a can of beans on some rice and call it black beans and rice. I highly recommend Molly Katzen, Moosewood, Laurel's Kitchen.

TONE_POLARITY,"Well, it looks pretty. . .but that's about as far as it goes. One wonders if the people that designed this strainer ever used it. The thing you don't find out until you have this in your hand is that that pretty stainless rim has an overhang on the inside. The result is that when you turn the strainer over to rinse out whatever you strained out, that material lodges in the overhang and is essentially impossible to clean out. I have only the 12.25"" size, but I'm guessing all the sizes in this line have the same problem. If you want a strainer as a kitchen decoration, then buy this. If you actually want to use it, don't buy it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I watched the Sharpe Series and have been reading the Saxon Tales. Given my interest in the Early middle ages I decided to try ""the Winter King"" and again found that Cornwell has created a realistic world in the past. He creates battle scenes that fit known facts about the times.While I found his Arthur to be more idealistic and peaceful then the era would expect. He more then makes up for it with more realistic women then he has in the Saxon Tales and his Merlin is cleaver creation. If this book ever makes the screen Merlin would be a role better then most.Sure wish this was the one picked by Made for TV instead of the SyFy channel Merlin.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II is a great investment for the biggest of blink-182 fans that may know everything about Mark, Tom, & Travis, to the fans that may be trying to learn more about them. This DVD includes indepth interviews with Mark, Tom, & Travis, the making of ""The Rock Show"", ""First Date"", & ""Stay Together For The Kids"" music videos. It also includes behind the scenes footage of blink-182 tour life, what goes on backstage, and while in the recording studio, & so much more. My favorite part of the DVD is right before the credits when Mark, Tom, & Travis talk about their friendship and the band to ""What Went Wrong"". Honestly, I would buy this DVD even if that was the only part it had on it. This DVD does have a PARENTAL ADVISORY warning on it, but it is mainly for the language in their songs. The Urethra Chronicles, Vol. II = Great Buy!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This recording is not great company. I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording? And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage? I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show. The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show. So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it! Some things are just perfect the way they are. Don't buy this CD. I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use.",,0

First off, all these new characters came and I must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. Another thing was the major changes between this book and Ender's Game.However I took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. I found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. I found once Ender got to Lusitania the story picked up greatly. Good read and I recommend it, four starts.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Very good practical advice for anyone who wants to get insight into curbing obsessive thinking.I would recommend this to anyone as a valuable self-help book whether you have OCD or not .The value is that it helps you identify and deal with thought patterns that are counter to your mental well being.The message of the book is the development of mindfulness but it is very practical and I have taken the authors advice to my benefit.It does go on a bit too much about the world of OCD sufferers which I got a bit tired of, but other people probably wouldn't . This is an immensely practical and commonsense approach to helping people with OCD and their families .I highly recommend this book.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"If you are considering this for a virtual desktop, this version is perfect and affordable. I ordered VMware Fusion and just followed the easy guide and after about 30-40 minutes everything was loaded, copied and finalized automatically.I gave a rating of 4 stars because I prefer the mac system over it, but for the price, and what I am using it for, it is perfect. I would only use this version over vista and others because your mac will run quicker. Eventually you may want to have at least 2gb of ram, but I am using 1gb which is recommended and it is fine.A note if you get VMware. It has a seamless ""unity"" option where you literally could not tell you were in xp. Once in that view mode, just click the application tab on the top and xp is at your fingertips!Enjoy!",,1

It feels fairly chintzy in hand, the bracelet is something like you would see from a Chinese knockoff, and the bezel is not as tight as I expected it to be.

This could only be fixed by the Legacy sending me a new one. The second time, the hose burst in the center. They sent a replacement hose. The third time, the hose burst again. I have never had any other hose burst in my house, so I don't think its my water pressure. I will say that the customer service is very good and they have sent out replacement parts. On top of the problems, the mechanism just doesn't work very good. I've had to adjust the tension so it won't rewind leaving about 5-10 ft left with no where for it to go. Even after adjust it, it works better if you leave the hose end open so the water is not in the hose. Of course this then leaves water everywhere as it wind up. I sometime thing it would be easier just wraping a hose around a hanger and be done with it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Neon delivers the best abs workout and I have fun doing it. She is very graceful, perfect cueing, awesome digital effects to show you the moves and whatnot. The exercise is broken down into 3 sequences, followed by a dance sequence/routine with each. You get a cardio workout because she does not stop and talk then move but you can follow her easily because she delivers perfect cueing through oral instruction and the special effects. I think the quality of the DVD is top notch and Neon is mesmerizing...I owned a LOT of bellydance workout and by far this one is the best!

However, the fit for the X61 is snug (as I wanted it to be) and therefore, do not count on placing any additional large-sized hardware (such as a power adapter, although a small mouse will fit) into the sleeve.

I must say in all my years of buying and renting movies I have never been wanted to break a DVD in half after only watching about 30 minutes into it. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and I stomached my way through Zombie Strippers which was so bad I prayed for death.

TONE_POLARITY,"It still amazes me that those who consider themselves to be Christians (after Christ; not Moses or Solomon, etc.)still keep some of what is ""called"" Biblical law. The Old Testament is a history book which is to lead a believer to the NEW Covenant which has put the Old Covenant (Old Testament) to rest. I shudder to think that the author of this booklet believes that Christ wants them to hit babies and children. Christ taught discipleship. The word 'disciple' means to bring one along side and teach them by instruction and example; not hitting or any other form of violence. I pray that the readers of such books and booklets will follow the example of Christ rather than an outdated, fulfilled, and cast-off Covenant which is no longer in effect.

Everything in Dual was stolen from evangelion, the main character was a shinji ikari rip off, and the two girls were EXACTLY like asuka and Rei. Even the mechs they had looked like evas. Its a pity that people would give this 5 stars.

TONE_POLARITY,"I enjoyed the first book quite a bit. It was a fun lighthearted read and I was looking forward to reading this book because I loved the idea of reading Darcy's side of the story. The first half of the book was fun albeit slightly annoying since the character of Darcy is somewhat annoying and pathetic. But then comes this rapid shift in the book where she ""becomes a better person"". It was such an abrupt switch/ a quick 180 that it hardly seemed believable and that's where the book went downhill for me. For 1.5 books the character Darcy was so utterly horrible and then somehow after one straight talk she gets it together and becomes a better person. I don't buy it and feel that there are many little moments in both books that the author could have set up so that the change in Darcy was believable. Something Borrowed is worth reading. Something Blue is not.",,0

I realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a Hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. His past books didn't really do that. Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse.

I only had a few plastic pots and hand tools on the shelves, so weight was not an issue, and I live in a temperate climate, so I don't think it was weather.To fix it required me to take everything out of the shed, completely disassemble it, reassemble it (now, of course, without the instructions). Even after doing this, it was still bowing out, so out came the trusty duct tape (pictures uploaded).

TONE_POLARITY,"Nickel Creek's debut album of the same name was pretty good so when ""This Side"" came out I had hopes it would be a good follow up. I was wrong, if you expect this album to be anything like the modern Bluegrass of the first album don't bother coming here. I liked many of the songs on the first CD but it seems like all of the selections here are much more Pop flavored, little or no tradition to them (the video I saw on TV was too weird to believe). Any of the group members can do much better than the work they display here, Sean Watkins is a good instrumentalist and Sara Watkins can really sing, but they left that behind on this one. Maybe a third album, if there is one, will be better.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not ""somewhat"" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted ""modern"" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6"" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6"" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a ""hero,"" this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a ""hero.""",,0

Animation that goes beyond the wonderful details and quality of the first. The ability to create new and powerful items and weapons, and use parts from the ones you find, or to buy parts.Play Magazine (Hey, I like to site my sources) has done a wonderful job covering it past issues, giving it a B+ on review (pretty high for them), and the reviews from other game magazines (Gamers, IGN, OPM) sound favorable too. Yeah, its going to be like the first one... its a sequel, set in the same place.

The lead actress in this one, I don't know her name (I will check now that I think about it, so I can avoid her in the future) delivered the WORST performance I have seen in a while.

TONE_POLARITY,"This filter was a breeze to install; granted, the old Kenmore brand filter that this new one replaced was installed with quick-release fittings. While the new filter came with nice brass fittings (with the tread already wrapped in teflon tape!), I decided to use my existing quick-release fittings, which allowed me to swap out the filter in less than a minute. So far, it has been a month, and the water tastes great. The 20,000-gallon life span of this filter was a major factor in my decision. I have well water, and this gives me peace of mind, knowing that my water is getting properly filtered. One thing you may want to do: read the instructions. The manufacturer recommends flushing the filter for a few minutes when you first connect it to the supply line to make sure there is no residual charcoal dust coming out of it.

You have 10 times the terror, suspence, and tension that you' d get from the run of the mill slasher film, without the gore. I'm not much into blood for the sake of it in films.There are some very disturbing scenes but the film's tension is based in the brilliance of the screenplay, cinematography, and the fabulous performance of the actors. I'd recommend Frailty to anyone.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Joe Pernice is definitely one of the best songwriters alive today. Yours, Mine & Ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although I will see how it stands the test of time). From the first listen, you know you must own this album. The opening track, Weakest Shade of Blue, is reminiscent of many songs Joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. As with most of Joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for Joe. For fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the Pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up. Ultimately this is a really fun Sunday drive with the windows down album.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"With some of the same tone and feeling as Nik Bärtsch's Ronin modal improvisations, this album of the postmodern avant-garde trio The Bad Plus demonstrates why they were selected for the recent album of Disney covers, Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,Let's take this movie into perspective. It's Mission Impossible 2...not the first...or the last. They're laying it out like the television series. Each episode is different. Each movie will be different and have a different feel to it...a different flavor. We can't be too critical about how it was compared to the previous film. The next one will be different still. Enjoy the movie for what it is. A journey into a world that most of us can't go. The cinematography was very Woo. It was fast paced and blended well with the soundtrack that accompanied it. The acting was well done and the story may not have been completely original...but it is still fun to see all the action that takes place from beginning to end. Buy this movie to have a good time and enjoy what these people have worked so hard to create for the audience. A good cutting-edge cinimatic adventure film with loud music and exciting new stunts never before seen on film. Enjoy.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this when I was in my early teens because I saw their pictures in Creem or Circus, and they looked so cool. Kiss was the band in black, and these were the guys in white. (Would be interesting to know how much influence the record company had in the choice of costume.) The music is interesting only because of what it says about the era. This is not good music. The delivery is just fine, but it's all so meaningless and soul-less. Much great music is one or the other, but not both! Still, I hope all these guys are doing OK; I'll never forget Angel.",,0

It's quite appropriate that Jerry Cantrell is opening for Creed and 12 Stones this time around because without bands like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Grunttruck, etc. neither one of these bands, as well as Bush, would have any idea of what to sound like. To even refer to them as 'Alternative' is about as far fetched as you can get. I must be getting old, because every 'new' band coming out these days sounds exactly the same and horrible at that.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have been using this mug for about 3 months now. I really like it alot although there are just one concern... The rubber O-ring on the lid that is essentially the spill proofing comes off the lid VERY easily if you are not careful when hand washing, therefore allowing your beverage to spill all over your car seat as it did mine. Now that I'm aware of this it hasn't been a problem since. Also, the claim of 8 hours of keeping your coffee hot is not realistic unless you work in a heated area. If you work in the cold it will go for about 2 or 2- 1/2 hours. The one thing that I didn't like before ordering is that it is only 16oz. HOWEVER, what I have found is that now my coffee is staying very hot for a longer period is that I drink it slower & the 16oz is sufficient.

TONE_POLARITY,"How sad it is, when a beauty of a book (Skipping Christmas) by an acclaimed author (John Grisham) is turned into a mess of a movie, it's only purpose being to rob hard-working people of their well-earned money. In watching this, I realized only one thing: Jamie Lee Curtis is getting old. She has gray hair. When did this happen?! This is a great example of a movie straining too hard to be funny. I felt like the Botox scene dragged on too long, and it was in the trailer so if you've seen the trailer you've seen basically that whole scene. Just don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it at all! If you're looking for a good Christmas movie for your family, try A Christmas Carol, A Christmas Story, (catch it anytime of the day you like Christmas day) or It's a Wonderful Life. And remember: It will be a Merry Christmas just as long as you don't spend it with the Kranks! Happy Holidays. Please rate if this review was helpful to you! Thanks!!",,0

I was intrigued by the name ""sick and twisted animation"" Well maybe if I was still in my 20's this may have been a bit more interesting. But as an ""official grown-up"" now it wasn't. I do appreciate the effort put forth into the making of these shorts, but they were just sort of lackluster. One dog humping a stuuffed animal maybe fine, but this film featured 3 such shorts, which made me lose interest very fast. There were also a number of shorts about cats.

TONE_POLARITY,"Great concept, fair execution. I expected much more from these discs. Most of the tunes on disc 1 are a bit too sparse for my tastes...I was expecting more ""electro"" or ""electroclash"" styles. The Juan Maclean track is more of an agressive style that I like...too bad the rest isn't in this same vein.I mainly bought this for disc 2. Many classics I have on vinyl and I wanted to see how this guy handled the mix...doesn't really come through. The Bigod 20 track is actually ""Body to Body"" and not ""The Bog"". The second Front 242 track is pitched up significantly...I would have worked it into the mix elsewhere.

I wont get into the confusing arguments about ""this happened because, the younger self did yada yada yada"", but I will say that after the last act of the film... NONE of the events prior should have happened -- but it did happen even though ""Character XYZ"" NEVER EXISTED. People still remember ""Character XYZ"" even though he/she NEVER EXISTED.

TONE_POLARITY,"John Norum's ""Optimus"" is a an incendiary cocktail that burns,without variation, into a symphonious burst of poetic expressions. The guitar work is consistent and pleasantly harsh, from beginning to end and the songs are even more interesting as they are stressed by John's ferocious and turbulent vocals.This album is -required by rule- for people that enjoy his work and it is a great place to start for new listeners interested or curious about his music.""Optimum"" creation!",,1

It makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body, as it has not helped my hair and this month of May makes it 4 months I have been using. YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO SEE SOME HUGE CHANGES WITHIN A MONTH TO 45 DAYS, AND NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!

I am definitely not a devout gamer, my last system was a Genesis, and bought this game out of nostalgia for the old Sonic.

Don't waste the money, buy NFL2k instead.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Like the other reviewers here, I too, counted THREE INTO ONE as one of the best anthologies by the pre-Ure Ultravox. That is, until this set came along. This generous anthology serves up all the key tracks - from the Eno-produced ""The Wild, The Beautiful And The Damned"" to ""My Sex"" and ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"", this version of Ultravox was the missing link between Roxy Music and Adam Ant, punk and new wave, glam and art-rock. Its influence on everything that came out of the U.K. in the eighties can't be measured. You certainly don't need all three Island albums; this set is absolutely all you require and you should do so without guilt or remorse. Recommended.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"No kidding--I am beginning to think McDonald's is paying Grafton to mention their products.How many times do Kinsey and Reba eat massive quantities of quarter pounders, moan with the pleasure, and discuss how unhealthy yet fabulously delicious they are? Does that have anything to do with the plot?Then once, when Kinsey went out for dinner, she says she passed McDonald's for one and went to a ""competitor's fast food restaurant."" What, she's not allow to include the words ""Burger King""??Pondering the possibility of product placement even began to distract me from the admittedly already weak story.Also, these stories have become period pieces, so locked as they are in the 1980s with typewriters and pay phones. Of course, to speed Kinsey ahead 15 years or so would mean that Henry would have passed on. So she's utterly locked into the time frame.",,0

While a different viewpoint may be refreshing, I found his constant focussing on the personal details of astronomers and others (e.g. the references to Kepler as ""smelly"" - I have never heard this before) suggestive of a sneering agenda.While the book is, in parts, entertaining and informative, I cannot trust anyone who says ""speed and acceleration are the same thing"".

TONE_POLARITY,"""Shane"" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.""Shane"" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness, his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the ""bad guy"".""Shane"" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this item about a month ago to clean our 20 year old medium brown carpet. It really is very sturdy and easy to set up. Just vacuum first, mix up the cleaner with water (I put in a small teapot full of boiling water along with the tap water), and clean away. Water in the recovery tank is dark gray/black every time and easy to empty. Wipe the bottom areas of the cleaner with paper towel when you're done (remove and rinse the brushes if you have time) and put away.I've done sections of the house little by little because it is so easy to get out and clean a section even if you only have an hour to work with. I'm only 5'1'' tall and find it easy enough to push around. It is noisy so I use earplugs to save my hearing.The best thing is that we're saving a ton of money over hiring a company to do it for you.

TONE_POLARITY,"I started using Nailtiques Formula 2 about a year ago. My nails were so thin and if I were lucky enough for them to grow at all, the tips would peel off. I tried many ""nail hardener"" products with no success. Nailtiques is the most amazing product and so easy to use. I don't use any remover - after a few coats are applied, it is so easy just to lift the whole coat off, and start over. I don't try to remove it off all my nails at once - just the ones that appear to need lifting off at the moment. Agreed you must be consistent with the application instructions but it only takes about 3 minutes to apply and dries pretty fast, like 10 minutes or so. This product is much cheaper ordering from amazon.com than buying locally even with shipping and handling. One review writer mentioned the bottle brush separating from the top - just reclose bottle until it catches on and start over.It finally stops this nuisance.",,1

If you're a woman who is a problem-solver rather than a talker, or a man who doesn't think that talking about emotions is ""gross women's stuff,"" you will get little from this book (except irritation).If you're in even a mildly non-traditional relationship, avoid this book at all costs.Comment",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"While Hot Springs isn't an awful book, it is a book with atrocious dialog, a predictable plot, and only a handful of interesting characters. In over 500 pages, I didn't find a surprise or a moment that captured my attention. Earl's nobility irritated, the stereotypical mobsters and molls were mere window-dressing, and the backwoods hicks were ridiculous caricatures.I will try others by the author as my wife swears that this is the worst of his books, and I generally trust her taste. For me, though, this was a disappointment. I can forgive a story that lacks originality if the writing is compelling; this isn't that book.

TONE_POLARITY,"I had to write a review for this hits collection because I completely disagree with the other sole reviewer. First of all, it is very well remastered. Sounds superb! Second of all, songs are NOT chopped off half-way through them. It is true... these are not the 12-inch dance-floor versions. They are the single versions!!! But, they are not abruptly edited, as the other reviewer may have led you to believe. Ultimate Collection has a well-represented collection of tracks from Shalamar's discography, even a few tracks from the pre-Howard Hewett period. The cd does not get five stars from me, however, because there are TOO MANY selections coming from the synthesizer-heavy late-'80s. Perhaps 17 tracks on an album is too much of a good thing sometimes! Otherwise, I have NO complaints!!!",,1

I was never a big Toby McGuire (sp?) fan, and I think Andrew Garfield plays a MUCH better Peter Parker. My only complaint about this movie is that they had to rush through the origin portion of the story. Since the origin of Spider-Man had already been established in the previous films, that part of the story seems rushed and incomplete here. Had this been the first Spider-Man movie, and the film would have had the opportunity to develop a better origin, I feel like it could have been the best Spider-Man movie yet.

Things are going great when all of a sudden princes and knights start trying to rescue her.

However, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program cannot restore the original file and folder structures, or even the original names of the files themselves, which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files. Therefore, if these issues are of concern to you, I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Simply put, The Two Towers is 33.3% of the best book ever. The others of course are the Fellowship of the Ring and the Return of the King. Some consider this as a trilogy, but its really just one long, awesome book. Action, adventure, majik, different races.. Everything to create an awesome work of literature is here. If you enjoy ANYTHING that has to do with science fantasy, TRUST ME!! Tolkien will be your favorite author on the subject.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Yo, I hate the band N'SUCK and I really don't want you to buy this cd. After reading the review stating what you REALLY get (it actually helped me), I have come to the conclusion that I needed to write a bad review (since for some reason this cd has no bad reviws and hardly any reviews, so I thought if I wrote a bad review, the overall score would acually go down *evil laugh*, because N'SUNC cds don't deserve overall ratings of 5). Moving on, I have no idea why anyone would purchase an interview cd. WHF?! Yea, dude, just chillin', listening to N'SUCK answer lame question where I don't really care about their answer, I just wanna hear their HOT voices, ohhhhhh! And who wants to listen to ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" I couls write MUCH better lyrics then that, folks, they say you WAY too much. If you really like the song, safe your money and watch the (very funny) Clueless episode where N'SUCK sing at that girls birthday party (I havn't watched Clueless in a LONG time). PEACE OUT!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this album specifically for the first cut. This song, Experiment in Terror, written by Henry Mancini and performed by Al Ciaola was used by as the theme song for Pittsburgh's Saturday night ""Chiller Theatre"" on WIIC Channel 11 for many, many years.

TONE_POLARITY,"I have to agree that this is a somewhat lackluster book. The protagonist, Kate Klein, is the prototypical Jennifer Weiner main character: thirtyish, Jewish, overweight, inappropriately (verging on annoyingly) clownish, and caught between the professional world and domestic concerns.The book is basically a chick-lit murder mystery. As with other Weiner stories, it conflates the fantastical and outlandish with the mundane, a formula that doesn't feel natural to me at all (e.g., when put on the spot at Kitty's funeral, Kate ends up singing ""If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands"" during a misguided eulogy--so over-the-top and not very funny).I find most of Weiner's characters to be uneven and underdeveloped, and Goodnight Nobody's are no exception. I am done with Weiner, and I am still trying to understand her overwhelming commercial success and critical appeal.",,0

If an average reader can get through the extremely long, and sometimes ineffective bible quotations (I barely made it through myself), they will find that in the end, this book is written to convert non-Christians to the 7th Day Adventist faith. The conclusions drawn are vague at best, and no substantial proof, other than the authors interpretation of bible sections, is given as basis for any idea. Anyone can see that huge corporations control world economy and that there are elitist groups and ""secret"" societies...but this book is so extremely slanted from the religious perspective of the author that it is off putting to anyone who choses to question Christianity or any organized religion.

TONE_POLARITY,I love this wine cooler. Prior to buying this wine cooler my wine was stored in cardboard boxes in the spare bedroom. This wine cooler is beautiful. Stainless steel door frame and black body make this wine cooler look sleek and elegant. It is so small it hardley takes up any space which is good because I live in a tiny 1000 sq ft condo. The fan is totally silent. I never hear it running. Why did I wait so long to buy it?The cooler only cools to 54 F. So white wines will still have to be chilled before drinking. The maximum ambient temperature for this wine cooler is 77 F. So it cannot be placed in a garage. The door opens from left to right. I am not sure it can be reversed like with refrigerators.

The sets had a luscious mouth that Nureyev dove thru, outrageously.

This is especially true of Alice (Adrienne King). She was too whiney and not pretty enough to be a heroine. Kevin Bacon was probably the best out of all of them, so it's no surprise he's the only one still heard of. The ending, while exciting, still was a disappointment.

TONE_POLARITY,"I think Leonard Maltin says it best - the film is ""ill conceived"". It's not funny, nor serious or off the wall. It's basically bland and that's amazing given the ensemble of talent in this film. I watched on DVD and the sound and video were excellent - it's sad, I feel the subject of the film has merit, it just never came off with the treatment it was given!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"On their debut album, Cheap Trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. Rick Nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney. There's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became. Forget the power pop bliss they're known for, because on this album Cheap Trick were aiming to rock.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"What audacity to name this film ""Incredible""! The only truly incredible aspect of this movie is how much of it is actually shot... in an aquarium. Not to mention... in an aquarium with species that DON'T live with these turtles in the wild! Didn't you think at least SOMEONE out there would take notice? The endless irritating shots of these turtles supposedly sharing an environment with brine shrimp (""Sea-Monkeys""), which only occur naturally in still-water salt lakes as in The Great Salt Lake, which are so saline, only these brine shrimp (hence their name) and a few fly species can survive, was shameful to relate to the public. There is an old saying in motion pictures which is proven time and again: If you aren't believable from the start... you are guaranteed to lose the audience. No amount of slick cinematography or sweeping soundtracks can erase the ill-gotten taste of ""phony"".",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"We used this product an average of once a month for 2 years and it no longer works. The company is out of business (no surprise). On a similar model from Mintek, they had to send out a recall because the battery would explode while charging. Please try another brand.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Nice snug hold for your Treo and high quality construction & feel; however, don't plan on using most of the device functions while it is in the cradle. The holster prevents you from opening the lid, accessing the jog dial, or accessing the outer function buttons while the Treo is in it. You can however put the phone in the holster with the lid open if you need to access the screen (e.g. I use this holster as part of my car mount). The buttons you can easily access include the up/down buttons for declining calls and the power/volume switches on top. Overall a very classy design for most purposes.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this Dutch oven about 4 years ago. We use it several times a month for roasts, soups, stews, etc. (perfect for cochinita pibil). Heats quickly and evenly and is easy to clean--even when you neglect to stir the contents and they burn on the bottom. Just a boil a little water in the bottom and the stuff lifts off. The only minus we have is that the inside is stained--but that's from the cochinita pibil, which braises in a red achiote sauce. This is at least as good as the other brands at a fraction of the cost. For me, it's a no-brainer!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I found the voice of the narrator and easy flow of thought to be not only phenomenally crafted but engaging in a way many books fail to ever achieve. Both Tina and Evelyn are great, heart wrenching characters and every success and failure feels like a direct reflection upon a secret life only you know you ever lived. However, despite this being such an amazingly written book I was frustrated to find that the ending felt like there was something more that should have been written but somehow had been forgotten during publishing. This could possibly just be my own feelings and I still highly recommend this read. I look forward to reading her other books and maybe down the road she'll revisit Evelyn and Tina and hopefully things will have continued looking up for them.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,This is the first movie that I have ever walked out on. After the second hour past I couldn't believe that the movie was still continuing with what seemed to be another subplot.

TONE_POLARITY,"I was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. It fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. Many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. For example, the ecologic radon studies of Bernard Cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by Drs. R. William Field and Jay Lubin to be without merit. However, I did find some of the writing heuristic.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Incredibly bad 1950's fantasy/horror movie about an abominable snowman on the loose in Los Angeles. Everything about this one--writing, acting, production values--is strictly grade Z. It is beyond belief that a major studio like Paramount was associated in any way with this thing. What were they thinking of? Ed Wood would have been ashamed to have his name associated with it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"From the box, this looks like a good horror movie, but it's not. It's slow, and there are no really scary scenes.

I would complain to Omron, but because it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth it. Especially if the next one fails as well. Also, the chest strap is too big for me (I wear a size 8 in US women's clothing, 32 in bra size). Even if I wear it as tight as it goes, it slips around. I should have looked at smaller models, so that's entirely my fault. The short lifespan of the device is most definitely not my fault however.",,0

It appears well researched and documented- the story line is just a bit scattered, but so is the topic. East India Company, Admiral Pellew (the real one), hurricanes, battles, life on an Indiaman ship and a better understanding of France and England in the early 1800's. (Imagine 200 soldiers and sailors living for months inside a space the size of a mid sized American house). Overall a very good read.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Just FYI: This review is for the 2nd Edition boxed set, not the D&D3; hardcover.There is much to the old axiom of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it', and as cliche as it might be, it holds very true to the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms boxed set. Oversized text and space wasting boarder art notwithstanding, the 2nd Ed boxed set incorporates all of the nonsense of the 'Time of Troubles' trilogy of novels. It also adjusts the Dale Reckoning time line by almost a hundred years for no reason. It gives scant overviews of too large of an area, and almost nothing on the things that really matter, like characters, noble houses, and rivalries between states. It also brings out the worst of the Realms, like munchkin characters such as Drizzt Du'Urden and Elminster. Stick with the grey 1st Edition Boxed Set, it's a much superior version.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"""Oh de Camptown Ladies sing dis song..."" I loooove this film. Some of the greatest comedians working with one of the Twentieth Centuries greatest directors. Mel Brooks turned what would have probably been quite a dreary script (originally called TEX X) into a work of pure comedic genius. There is something quite subversive about this film that he never quite managed before or since.Cleavon Little as Sheriff Bart is right on the button, especially in his initial reaction to the townsfolks bigotry (""Oh, Lordylord!!! He means it!!!! Do what he say!!!!!!""). Gene Wilder is at his absolute peak never missing a laugh and even getting some quite unexpected giggles from some rather mundane lines. Harvey Korman, Madeline Kahn, Slim Pickens... in fact the casting is so right that this is one of the most faultless spoofs ever made!!!!!!""...do dah, do dah.""",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Robert Jordan's last book has helped me in two areas. The first was to improve my speed reading; I only had to read every 10th page to understand the plot. Second was the security that I would be saving money in the future, this is the last time I will be duped into buying another one of his books. It's hard to understand how an author could start out so interesting and end up so boring. I wonder if money has anything to do with it?",,0

TONE_POLARITY,These books have been a great solution for having my [kid] read every evening for his school reading log. He enjoys the stories very much and the chapters lengths are minimal. He easily gets a good 10 minutes read each evening with only an occasional difficult word. He enjoys them so much that now I don't even have to remind him that he needs to read a chapter ... I look in to his room at night and he already has the book out! I love that there are so many books in this series - I plan on buying them all for him :) What a great habit of reading he has gotten in to through the Magic tree House series!,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This was undoubtedly the inspiration for the Tim Allen Films. It is one of the best Christmas stories I know of. It is no wonder that this particular episode was set apart and put out as a special VHS tape.

TONE_POLARITY,"A Matter of Trust By: Anne SchraffThe book is mainly about trust. The author's purpose of writing the story is mainly to say to trust people even if you do not want to. The main characters in novel are Brisana Meeks, Darcy Wills, and Hakeem Randall. Darcy and Hakeem are dating and they think that trust is big factor in a relationship. Brisana Meeks is a trouble maker who loves to make people angry. My favorite character is Darcy because she learned to put her trust in people and let them learn to trust her. She also learned to forgive and forget all the hurtful things people have done to her. You can learn to relate to other people through the things they have been through. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic, suspenseful, and comedy books. I would also recommend this book to both male and female teenagers who like to read.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This book is absolutely horrible. The first couple of chapters were okay---but as I went on reading, it only got worse. Justine is probably the most self-centered, unlikable character I've ever read, it made me wonder what on earth Barry saw in her to begin with, even though he wasn't any better at times.Valerie Brock wrote a book about two shallow characters that fall in love under the most ridiculous circumstances I could read. I agree with most of the reviewers here, this book is painful, I couldn't finish it, after about four chapters left to read, I just didn't bother anymore and judging by the reviewers, I'm glad I didn't waste any more time although I did waste my money on this sorry excuse for a book.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"There are many good things about this book - the theorems are beuatiful and they are part of 'real' mathematics. The writing is reasonably good. The only qualm I have is that the audience is quite specialized, more so than for most 'popular math' books. I think that anyone who has not had at least 3 semesters of calculus will find this mostly meaningless. However, for those who are familiar with calculus, this is an excellent book.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the ""commercial"" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed.",,1

Unlike other fans of The Moody Blues, I don't dislike their new stuff. As a matter of fact, I really liked ""Strange Times"". But, on this CD, only the 3 Justin Hayward originals are worthy. I don't mind the boys covering a few tunes now and then, but it seems like they knocked these off in an afternoon. As for the John Lodge tunes, his songwriting was what originally lured me to this band many moons ago. What happened? His songs now don't have that same, uh, what do you call it? As for Justin Hayward, what can I say? Great songwriter, great singer, great musician. Keep up the great work.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I love fiction and nonfiction books about Queen Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots, and their century. But this was a real disappointment. It didn't offer any new understanding of the time period or of Elizabeth or Anne's characters. The love scenes were awkward and embarrasing. They seemed gratuitous and out of place. Thank goodness there are other good books about this period out there. Check out Alison Weir, Reay Tannahill or Patricia Finney for good books set in 16th century England.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Twain could always come up with a good yarn, and this is as good as any, so far as plot is concerned. But this send-up of the Sherlock Holmes genre never really gets off the ground. A send-up should be funny. But there is too much in the plot that is evil and dark, so Holmes' appearance -- and his incorrect solution -- become merely annoying. The reader on the tape version does what he can to keep things moving along, but he cannot stifle the inevitable feeling in the listener that this is Twain churning out words for money. Still, it IS Twain after all, and so it does have its moments. Just not enough of them.",,0

Furthermore, although the pan is quite ""rough"" looking, it's incredibly durable. My impression is that it's almost impossible to permanently damage this pan...

Worked great the first time, left it on the kitchen floor...saw a small water stain on the floor. Used it one more time, the next day...then it turned into a friggin water sprinkler and spilled everything it had on the floor slowly. I read the reviews before I bought it, thinking it were flukes...but this is why they sell so cheap. But hey, it has a 90-day warranty.

It worked perfectly for about 2 months, and then I had to take it in to the authorized repair shop in our city for a new blade assembly because it no longer blended the frozen fruit; this was done under warranty at no cost to me. The repairman said to add the liquid first, and then add the fruit through the hole in the lid while the motor was running because the blades don't grind frozen fruit--they cause it to ""explode"". I took the repaired blender home, where it made 2 or 3 good fruit smoothies before going back to its old trick of not blending the frozen fruit again. It will still make shakes with ice cream and the like, but forget the fruit smoothies. So I guess I'll be going back to the repair shop and seeing what can be done--or asking for a replacement.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a truly beautiful work. I've bought some CDs at the local record store and was very disappointed before I wised up and started looking through the reviews here at Amazon for some better material. This looks not like a Western collection, but like an actual Chinese CD. The liner notes have a rather melancholy feel to them, and this is reflected in some of the music showcased here -- piece number 4, Parting and Yang Guan, is particularly moving. The instruments evoke deep emotions; one in particular (I don't know what it is called, but it sounds like a violin) literally does not ""play"" but rather ""sings"" these sweet, expressive, minor-keyed melodies. The haunting voice of this instrument weaves itself all throughout the pieces, narrating stories that are foreign and yet very, very real to a western listener. This collection really deserve the title ""Masterpieces"". I only wish I knew where to find other works of this high quality.",,1

Since the kids will take longer to read the book they will understand it better. To really enjoy this book you have to read it slowly. I highly recommend this book for you.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm really disappointed in my new Corelle Coordinates Callaway 2-1/5 qt. whistling teakettle. First of all, I can't boil 2 quarts of water without it boiling over. I frequently wish to boil just 2 quarts to make iced tea for my family or church events. When I do boil water and try to pour it out, it runs back and makes a mess on my kitchen counter or on the table. If I leave the lever down over the spout while it boils, I have to use a potholder to lift it to be able to pour the water out. The noise it makes when the water boils is not a ""whistle"", but a low rumble. I do like the outside design. Right now I'm shopping for a new teakettle and it won't be a Corelle brand.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this mount as a replacement for my original Garmin mount, which lasted about 3 years. Big mistake. This one lasted about 3 weeks! I don't normally remove the mount once I have it in place, and I do not even keep the GPS sitting in the bracket when not using it.Even so, the mount stayed firmly attached to the windshield--- until I used the GPS for a long trip-- The mount fell off about 2 hours into the trip. Upon closer inspection, it was obvious that the suction cup had torn/separated from the plastic mount inside the bracket base! All this was done without pulling or applying any pressure whatsoever to the mount-- Very simply, the weight of the GPS itself (a small Nuvi 200 series) was enough to cause the suction cup to separate!What a joke. save your 2 bucks+shipping and buy a genuine Garmin mount.

TONE_POLARITY,"To start with, I am a Greene fanatic, so you might take my opinion with a grain of salt. I didn't read The End of the Affair for many years after I'd read virtually all of Greene's other novels. I love his thrillers, his adventures, his ""serious"" works. But I didn't think I'd love a book about an adulterous affair, particularly one with God and Catholicism at its center. I finally got around to it. How wrong, wrong, wrong I was.Having read it twice, I now have to ask whether it's Greene's best book. Every aspect of the book is unexpected: the reason their affair ends, why she leaves, who the man she's seeing is, Bendrix's response, all the way to the end where Bendrix befriends her husband.What in other hands would have been a simple morality play, is so much more thrilling.

This,however, is not worth the money. #1- You spend so much time trying to put your feet on the dots while doing the routine. #2- The routines aren't even routines.

TONE_POLARITY,This book is very similar to journal articles. The material is highly compressed and assumes that the reader is among the 1000 most skilled people in the world in this area and is totally knowledgable in the state of the art of six months ago and earlier. It therefore leaves out things that a new learner in the area would need to know. This explains why there are so many copies available used and their low prices and their fine/unused condition.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Ms. Edwards has created characters that are not very realistic. I found it difficult to relate to the motives of any of these characters. David was certainly not anyone I've ever run across.His character was totally unbeleivable. Ms. Edwards needs to talk to more men. The passages relating to his photography were boring. Who cares???? I didn't egt the connection she was trying so desperately to make between David's passion for photography and his ""losses"".I had a hard time believing that Norah was suffering so VERY much yet since the death of her daughetr at birth, that when she finally meets her...she takes off to France w/ her new husband.

TONE_POLARITY,"I enjoyed this cd very much. This recording has something for everyone. Motown (my strongest suit), soul, gospel(the gods love nubia), rock(fortune favors the brave), pop(A Step too Far), and classic broadway love songs(enchantment passing through, elaborate lives). The album has a great sense of flow from one song to the next, and the story is not very hard to follow, either by listening to the lyrics or reading the synopsis inside the booklet. I am NOT a fan of elton john, but i found the music very entertaining. Whether you like disney, elton john, tim rice, broadway, or just plain good music, there is a strong chance that you will enjoy this cd as much as i did. Buy it!!!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone.",,0

Full range clutch that can even do light drilling. Comes with a nice charger and TWO batteries. Again, beats the others in overall value and features. Well built and ergonomically excellent.

TONE_POLARITY,"Ok, so he's suppressing alot of rage, but damn is this a good cd! I have not bought a rap album since Public Enemy's ""Fear Of A Black Planet"" in the very early 90's. This cd has restored some of my faith in rap music as a credible music form. He's not spewing out how rich he is or how many cars or women he has, instead he just goes off on, well, everything. But, Eminem uses his rage to create some very witty, surprisingly intelligent and savage lyrics which will make you fall out of your seat (either from shock or from sheer laughter). A bit rough around the edges, true, but he pretty much offers a commentary on how things really are, which we need more of in a somewhat phony society. Good stuff!",,1

I am not exaggerating when I tell you that there are more than three or four of these types of inclusions on every page. I don't know why a respected doctor would litter his book and obscure his message with gratuitous (and lame) jokes.I'm all for information the ""Average Joe"" can comprehend and a dieting book that isn't a drag to read, but seriously, this is a right mess.

I figured the shopping thing with the card would not work, but I figured it would be worth the money I paid if she were able to play with the clothes it came with. Wrong! Not sure what Barbie those clothes are supposed to fit. They did not fit any of my daughters barbies, only one shirt or skirt (can't remember which) was usable, the rest were way too small and useless. We even tried them on Bratz dolls too, but they did not fit the Bratz dolls properly. This was a toy that ended up in the garbage the first time I went through her toys after Christmas.

TONE_POLARITY,"Wow. The title is so offensive I just had to write the review. I did read the book, and while it presents compelling internal logic, I think it has a slight problem. Internal logic doesn't need to consider external reality. That is why people claim that they can prove the ""international Jewry"" run the media. A logic that does not take into acount the external is fiction, because it doesn't look at what is real. This sort of book I will call ""current event historial fiction."" For instance: Despite what this book implies, the wealthy should probably have more of their income taxed than the poor. Say you make $2.5 milion a year. Given a 25% tax, you pocket $1,875,000 a year. If you make $25,000 a year, you pocket $18,750. Yet the poor get taxed more than the rich because the rich supposedly earned all of their money, whereas poor and undereducated minority workers are lazy.

TONE_POLARITY,"SOUNDS OF NATURE: AT THE LAKE is supposed to be an environmental recording of ambient lake sounds designed for relaxation. Unfortunately, the recording is spoiled by the unnecessary manmade sounds of someone rowing a boat---recorded from inside the boat with its hollow echoing sound---so that the calm and natural lake sounds are interrupted by the bumping and sliding of aluminum oars and the sound of disturbed water, and lastly, the sound of the oarsman coming to dock and clumping away from the microphone. Since the sound loop is only about 5 minutes long and the disc is an hour we get treated to this disruption repeatedly. While it's not an outboard motor, there's just no reason it had to be included in a ""Sounds of Nature"" CD.There are undoubtedly better environmental CDs available.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This version of the Scarlet Pimpernel is infinitely inferior to the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellan. The screenplay is incoherent and confusing; events necessary to the understanding of the story are shown in flashback, usually long after the viewer needs the information. The dialogue runs the gamut from the witty to the banal (the prison scene between Marguerite and Percy exhibits the most offensively trite dialogue). But the worst aspect of this video is the casting of Elizabeth McGovern as Marguerite. Even playing a former actress is a stretch for her. Richard Grant as Percy and Martin Shaw as Chauvelin are quite good, although not nearly as good as Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellan in the same roles.The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderfully heroic, romantic story set in the French Revolution. This 1998 A&E production does not do it justice.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The songs on this album are all outstanding, but any Specials or Desmond Dekker fans out there are in for a disappointment. The producers decided to run all the instruments and vocals through a reverb effect in an apparent attempt to replicate Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound. In addition, most of the tracks are overrun by sustained synthesizer chords. Ska's catchiest attribute is its sharp rhythms, but the morons in the booth ruined it by drowning out the quality. What's their motivation? Lord knows, but I've always detested producers who try to become part of the act themselves by manipulating the message instead of fine-tuning it. Close your eyes, and you'll think you're trapped in some horrible karaoke bar. These two classic acts deserved better.",,0

He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'.

TONE_POLARITY,"In spite of my only chosing 2 stars for the book, I can see why ""The Light Ages"" was chosen for the World Fantasy Award. Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along. I finally gave up, even though I enjoyed reading about the world Macleod was creating, because I felt it was taking too long to get to the action.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Hemingway is one of my favorite novelists. Fortunately, he is as terrific a non-fiction writer as he is a fiction writer.He shows you a Paris that was so full of life, and opportunity; You can immediately see why American writers flocked there in droves in the twenties.In this book, the writing is so good that you feel that you are drinking in the quaint Parisian bars until all hours, and that you, too, are drinking in all the sights and scenes of the most inspiring city in the world at that time.Also, from his friendship with Gertrude Stein to the guilt he felt after an adulterous affair, Hemingway holds back nothing.For two years I lived in Oak Park, IL, where Hemingway was born and raised. The community has made the house he lived in a museum honoring him, and holds a Hemingway festival. I sorely miss living there; it certainly isn't Paris back in Hemingway's time (what is?!)but it is wonderful to have a museum to such an adventurous American writer.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"There is much in this book that will appeal to those who enjoyed classics such as the Diary of Anne Frank or the Hiding Place. Set in World War II Russia as Communism runs rampant, it chronicles the pensive musings of a girl trapped not in a prison or concentration camp, but a hospital bed. Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight. Marianna's reflections may provide a valuable guide to those who face similiar trials in any age, showing a new way of measuring strength. However, the rambling quality will be off putting to many.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer.",,0

I don't know what kind of criteria the Booker Committe uses, but I just didn't see this book as worthy of any kind of award. The moral dilemna that were suppose to develope just didn't happen.

The album is just boring and overly noisey. Who mixed this thing? You can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. Some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener ""Hexagram"" which is as melodic as it is brutal. ""Bloody cape"" would be a good track on Around the Fur. And contrary to most fans beleif, ""Anniversary.."" is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of ""teenager"" on White Pony. The rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the My Bloody Valentine sounding ""Minerva"". Overall, Deftones is a dissapointing album.

As others have said, get calipers and learn how to use them.Also, people, forget about BMI. This was a measurement developed to study POPULATIONS, and never intended for the evaluation of individuals. Use common sense. How can a value that considers only weight and height be a valid reflection of an individual's health and fitness? Muscle is denser than fat, so an individual with minimal muscle will show a lower BMI than a heavily-muscled one of the same stature.

I like the idea that someone would choose to emigrate to North Korea because of their political ideology. Most of the actual American defectors went to North Korea because they were running away from something, and this book actually postulated what would happen if someone were to run to the ""Communist wonderland"" as the North puts forth in their propaganda.

Having flown those missions myself as a Covey FAC, 1968-69, I can vouch for the authenticity of his book.

TONE_POLARITY,"Note the heavy use of ellipses in the reproduction of the New York Times review. And even so, it hardly seems like a raving review, does it? Before buying this book (or even investing your time in reading it), I highly recommend that you go back and read the full text of the Times review. In light of Tepper's past literary accomplishments, the review of this book was particularly harsh, which could be distilled into a few words: poorly-crafted, badly-plotted, overbearing polemical tract",,0

To me it wasn't a waste of money since I'm just going to use it as a giant mug and I don't need it to stay warm until the evening. Last time I used it, I filled with 200 degree F coffee and at 6:00 am, I didn't use it until 2 pm and when I poured it out it was room temp maybe slightly warm.So used as a large mug, used immediately (or within a few hours) after filling, it's not bad.EDIT (end of Dec 2009):I just threw it out. It doesn't hold heat anymore (about 1 month of use) and there is nothing redeeming abou it anymore.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,We purchased this book thinking it might be useful for our medical students. It is not. This book has numerous basic errors of pharmacology principles. It is laid out well and communicates things clearly however it is misleading and wrong about important aspects of pharmacology.

I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod.

TONE_POLARITY,"Hayley Westenra's new album ""Pure"" will affect you deeply if you like uncommonly pleasant singing. It's a ""stealth"" voice, to be sure, in that it sneaks in sweetly and harmlessly enough, but by album's end you find yourself wondering what just happened. You'll scratch your head and ask, ""Did I just experience the finest human voice in all the world?"" Then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.So let's just get it out in the open: Hayley Westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and ""Pure"" will almost make you forget about Norah, Barbra and Celine.As obscure as she is in the USA today, word of mouth about ""Pure"" will eventually elevate Hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists.

""My Little Chickadee"" (1940) is an unsuccessful patchwork of two comedic styles that simply do not mesh.

TONE_POLARITY,"I was looking at some stores for an Apple iPod a few weeks ago. I stumbled upon this 20 Gigabyte one that caught my attention. It was only $299.99 which is only fifty bucks more than the iPod mini which only holds 1,000 songs. This iPod holds 5,000 songs and is a very good deal. Sony's Mini Disc Players are good too, but they just don't stand up to the iPod. The outside has a sleek white coating which looks high-tech. The back is metal but the only bad thing is when you put your fingerprints on it it sticks to the iPod which can be seen easily. You should buy a case if that happens. They have really nice see through cases that fit snuggly on it. I'm recommending this for any one who reads this but if you have children it's almost Christmas time and they might be wanting to get this!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The sardonic brain trust that comprised Steely Dan in this outing, explore with delicious irony and wit various ills and taboo associated with American societal organisation; moreover, in the decade that followed the one undeniable theme that comes from this album and its predecessor (Aja) is that despite the inevitable innovation, production advances and marketing associated with the music industry, that those lyrics and music, which will stand the test of time comes from both individual musician and songwriters whose passion is to tell us a story or to evoke through music both pleasure and pain that has been either masked or embellished. Something the popular music failed to accomplish in the eighties, thanks goodness these musician and lyricist saw fit to utilise, jazz, pop rock and words to suggest to the next generation of musician and songwriters that it is indeed about the music.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This is the sort of book that gives art history--especially the ""new"" art history--a black name.

I really like that it has the bamboo roller as I did a lot of research before making this purchase and read that those are much easier and more efficient for rolling sushi. This package was great and had basically everything, except I wish it included the sesame seeds for what it costs (or used to cost, I see it's about $10 less now). Although it was easy to pick up the seeds at my local grocery store, just an extra trip - which nobody likes.It shipped and arrived very timely and in great condition.I can't review on how well everything works as I haven't heard if they've actually made sushi yet, but it definitely looked nice and was very well received!",,1

I contacted the company, but they could care less and they not only won't tell you how to repair them, but they don't sell repair parts. I guess it's just as well because they ignored me when I asked them what the problem could be. They just wanted to sell me more. I had already spent hundreds of dollars with Havahart so I checked out their competition, Scarecrow. Finally I got a product that works without consistently breaking down. I now have several Scarecrows and they all work just fine. I also have several Havahart's dead in my garage. My opinion is, ""HAVAHART DOESN'T HAVE-A-HEART.",,0

The vise jaws are not very rigid, though for holding circuit boards and wires for soldering they do the job OK.

TONE_POLARITY,"The rogues, tricksters, mentally-ill, gamblers, alcoholics and ne'er-do-wells in Risk Pool are nothing less than adorable. Russo writes beautiful prose that pulls at every one of the reader's emotions. Here, he creates a cast of loafers with a dry humor that will have you laughing out loud at times.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is an introduction into the Kennedy family, but beyond that the book is not very helpful. The author Jay David Andrews drew most of his material from other popular books (such as All Too Human by Edward Klein) and articles about the Kennedy family. Andrews does not divulge deeply into the Kennedy family, the myths, truths, or provide any new insight or information to make this book worth reading. As another reviewer stated, this book has a tabloid quality about it that detracts from the quality of the book. A reader will learn more about the Kennedy's by reading other news magazine reports and other books about the subject.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I am a sucker for good romantic stories - however, A Walk to Remember is a disappointing third book by Sparks. The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in ""The Notebook"". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from ""The Notebook"" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"We purchased this unit January of 2005. We experienced no problems for about 9 months after which the CD player started being very picky about how the cd was loaded and we often had to try loading or ejecting multiple times. Finally in August 2006 the cd player just stopped working. It took the cd, refused to play it and now will not eject it.The reception has always been poor, but since that was not my primary usage I was able to live with it, but this last event was the last straw.I have purchased Cambridge SoundWorks speakers in the past and I have been very happy with them. I thought this unit would be made with similar quality but it is not. I cannot recommend this unit any longer. It is unreliable and poorly made.

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this book to learn more about early Roman history prior to a trip planned later this year. This is one of the most tedious reading experiences I have ever had! It provides limited background and understanding to the culture, and instead is a boring composite of internal issues between several primary characters - none of whom are developed to the point that I cared about them. Dealing with the 3-4 word Latin names for each character (many of which were almost identical), added to the torment. I rarely do not finish a book - but after 600+ pages, I give! And unfortunately, I asked for (and received) the entire series for Christmas. What a waste!",,0

I'll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry/itchy patches I might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought these to use on trips to India that included long flights and layovers. I got a pair of Koss over-the-ear style headphones for use when I wanted some noise to filter in (flight announcements, etc) but I also wanted a pair to block out the world. The Sparkplugs did exactly that. The foam inserts expand within your ear to provide a snug fit that keeps out external noise. I agree with other reviewers that the bass is a bit lacking, but as has been suggested, simply blocking the holes on the outside of the buds corrects that completely. My only complaint is that after a while, one of my ears always got a bit sore. Might be because I have pretty small ears that all buds have a hard time staying in. Regardless, these are worth having. For longer term use, and for when I don't need the sound cancelling, I liked the Koss Portable over-the-ear set.Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones",,1

It offers a realism not usually featured in Kings outrageous novels, a realism that makes you stop and think.

As enjoyable as the Corrs are live in a stadium or arena type atmosphere the 'Unplugged' session shows best of any of the Corrs DVD's there fantastic musical talents and also the best sound of any of the DVD's.

For a few dollars more, not even a fist full of dollars, you can get much better.Why do they make a place to keep the wench and hex-key they give you and then tell you to always be sure to remove them from the holder before using the saw? Is it because they may come in contact with the blade?Why is the lazar on the one I HAD so hard to adjust that I never did move it in fear that it would break? Is it because you can still use the saw without the lazar that is going to break someday anyway?The saw I HAD came pre-set to build Toontown. All the angles were off just enough for Goofy and Daffy Duck to do just fine with it.I have Hitachi's hand-held circular saw and it works OK. Their nailers are tops.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this item and found it much too high. Most chairs are 16-18"" high and a transfer bench should be chair height. Other transfer benches can go this low. Looking at the manufacturer's website, I find that this item can be adjusted to 20.5-25.5 inches high. Since the legs that go into the tub need to be shorter than those that go outside the tub, the transfer bench will be perhaps 22 inches off the floor when the bench is level. For many people, their legs will be hanging at this height or they will be sitting on the edge of the bench weight resting on their wet slippery feet. It's ridiculous that the supplier hasn't warned potential customers that this item is unusually large.In all other respects, this transfer bench seems perfect fine.

In addition to thorough archival research, the author's own journey on foot through all thirty-three miles of a canyon that is steeper and narrower than the more famous Grand Canyon, the reader is deftly introduced to seventy-six river crossings, and informed of a brush with death that forcefully illustrates the power, majesty, and danger of this great natural resource and wonder.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Wow, what a total dissapointment. If this were a Power Rangers Megazord I would have to give him 5 stars. But as a Transformer, he isn't. Yes, he's got good articulation, but thats it. His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out. Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a ""transformer"" and only gets 1 star...yuck.",,0

The batteries bearly last two walks, for some reason, they are really drained by the player. Overall, I bought this player in December and am throwing it out in Mid February, along with two of my favorite CD's. Not a great statement about the quality for the price.

But this , whats the point? It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke",,0

Even though their color would hide most flaws, the quality is so obviously poor it would be embarrassing for anyone to wear them.I also would like to note that the white gold settings are not as shown in the picture. The stones are propped up on top of settings so the white gold cannot be seen on the perimeter when viewed directly from the front.I ordered them a couple of days ago but now when I view the item, it says ""Item under review"" due to customer feedback.

TONE_POLARITY,Lauren writes:My First Day at Nursery School by Becky Edwards is about a little girl who does not want to go to nursery school because she is scared. Instead she wants to stay with her mommy at home. She has never been to a school. She has never met anyone or played with other children without her family knowing the other family. Her first day is the most important day for her and she does not want to be embarrassed. I recommend this book for kids who are 2-4 years old. 2-4 is appropriate age group because most likely anyone older than 4 has gone through their first day of school. I was about 3 when my mom first read this book to me. I was nervous for my first day of school just like the little girl. I give My First Day at Nursery School by Becky Edwards a 4 out of 5 rating. Will the girl like nursery school? Or will she want to go home? Read My First Day at Nursery School to find out.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Good Points: Long extension cord you can actually get around the house with. Nice color. Easy waste dispenser. Picks up fairly well.Bad Points: Heavy and no belt so hard to push (and carry). Attachments go on handle so if vacuum not positioned properly when not using utensils, the air suction is in your face. No lever in back to position head - you must instead step on front. Head angles low but bulky so difficult to get under things anyway. Also does not angle up high enough to go from carpet to floor to carpet- you cannot raise front high enough to get onto carpet. The bristles make an awful sound going from floor to carpet (especially if you have fringed area rugs) as if seizing up. You have to clean the bristles after each use because of so much accumulation getting caught when dealing with pet hair. Only two postions- carpet or floor.Wish I had done my homework. This is definitely the `cheaper model'.",,0

I noticed that my undereye circles were suddenly more pronounced. (To be clear--I wasn't anticipating immediate results but was checking for any sort of reaction.) So I went online and read a few more reviews. I must have not been paying close attention before, as I did not see all the reviews noting increased redness and allergic reactions. I went immediately and rubbed it off. My skin has a slight redness but no itching or bumps. The area around my eyes looks very sensitive, as though I've been crying and rubbing the sensitive skin around my eye.I am returning this tomorrow to the local organic grocery store and purchasing Vitamin K capsules instead.

And its message applies not only to our domestic policy but to many of our international policies as well. But it does it in a way that is never preachy and is informative and entertaining.

TONE_POLARITY,"I became interested in killer sudoku after I came across a handful of puzzles in Will Shortz's sudoku world championship book. I got bored of regular sudoku because it got kind of monotonous. Killer sudoku is a lot more fun and satisfying, and you really have to think to crack hard puzzles. Conversely, at least in my view, the key to solving regular sudoku is just staring at a puzzle until you find a hole.I was looking forward to getting this book after I finished all of the puzzles in Killer Sudoku: The Deadly New Dimension. Unfortunately, I found the puzzles in the book too easy. Even many of the puzzles in the ""harder"" sections -- Challening and Vexing, for example -- can be solved in under 10 minutes.In this book, the puzzles just aren't challenging. If you want to try to killer sudoku for the first time, I would recommend this book. If you want something a little tougher, get the Deadly New Dimension.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Davies' book is extremely narrow and there is no real attempt to place the Navajo's experiences in a broader context.

There are numerous errors in the text (better copy editing and, even more importantly, a better knowledge of the field of medical history would have made this book a better and easier read). The book is pitched as a second half to White Man's Medicine---a book written by one of Davies' professors in graduate school. White Man's Medicine is a much better book and I am sorry to see Healing Ways paired with White Man's Medicine.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"She croons the album title, ""Oops I did it again"" with a fake sincerity. I should say this of the whole album.There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album. Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line. The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion. So no she did not do it again.She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself. That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is. Who is the ""I"" in ""I did it again""? Clearly it's not the ""me"" in ""Baby, hit me one more time.""I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her. I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less.

I am a non-denominational christian who was raised catholic, so i've seen both sides of the coin regarding excorcism and spiritual warfare. Not only is this book one-sided in favor of oldschool catholocism, but it focuses on evil in such a way that compells and captivates the reader, glorifying Satan in a not-so-obvious way. Remember, Satan is the father of lies, and many might think reading a book about excorcism written by a jesuit priest is harmless and safe, when in fact it is not.

The problem with all of these sappy teen pop stars is that all theyc an do is ballads. If you have a good voice, as I give that Justin does, ballads are a piece of cake, but to write and sing a song that really get's people moving, that is so much more of a challenge.

Guarded is also very good it has in your face sound right from the get-go. Enough said. Go out and buy this album, you are wasting precious time reading these reviews.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The ""Sonic Christmas Blast"" DVD consists of the Sonic Christmas Blast special (about 22 minutes long) and 3 Sonic Underground episodes. The Christmas episode itself seems like only a child would enjoy it (and probably a young adult that saw the special when it originally aired in the late 90's). The animation and plot is laughably simple and ridiculous.As for the 3 Sonic Underground episodes, they're terrible. Children might be confused by the sudden change of characters and plot when the Christmas special ends and the Underground episodes begin. Underground is a completely different series in which Sonic has a brother and sister and is on a quest to find their mother. The animation consists of moddy dark colors, the plot itself is a little dark (very much so for a children's cartoon) and in each episode Sonic and his siblings sing a terrible song that makes Barney seem like Pavarotti.If you're buying for kids, it may be a decent DVD. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I started watching the film with great expectations but was soon disappointed, the 3-D effects were weak and the picture fuzzy. The glasses supplied with the DVD were scratched and cheap so I used my own. I have been interested in stereoscopic phototography and movies for many years so know what is possible. In short a poor effort and in my opinion not worth buying.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I happened to see this text in the publishers store new in hard cover. It is an English translation (Barnes & Noble, 2000) from the French (La civilization de l'Occident medieval by B. Arthaud, Paris, 1964; English translation by Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1988)with an updated bibliography. It is a good survey of the period and allows for insight into modern history of the West. I obtained it to have on hand for not only myself, but the grandchildren who may be exposed to more ""revisionist history."" The price was great in store at $12.98 when it was originally published at nearly three times the price.",,1

I was suprised to see that it had screen protecters (i got it at gamestop) I love the styluses they are the best I've ever had but the screen protecters are bad. the bottom screen protecter was so hard to put on that i tried so many times and it got messed up so i had to throw it out. the one on the top was OK even though i got alot of glares with it... when it got all scratched up and i took it off, it left a sticky residue that made me spend a half hour wiping it with a paper towel soaked with windex... this almost messed my whole ds up... im never putting screen protecters (from pelican) on my ds again..... the styluses are great though",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I've used this bag twice a week for school for the past 8 months, and every single one of the cloth zipper pulls have unraveled/shredded. The more the pulls unravel, the more they are caught in the zippers. So I've had to cut them all of them off. The seams of the backpack are also coming unraveled such that 2-inch-long threads are hanging loose at seams all over the bag. Now I'm on Amazon shopping for a better quality backpack.UPDATE: High Sierra has a 100% satisfaction guarantee for their products. The claim was very easy to file and quickly processed.

TONE_POLARITY,"I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time ""chicken and liver"" from the same company. I'm praying.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Jesse very calmly observes his target, while his target thinks he's getting the low-down on whom he perceives as a very stupid sheriff. Jesse's persona is deceiving. He's a guiet man who watches other people's behavior. Jesse's very quick as a trained post LA cop turned sheriff in a sleepy town. His instincts are very good at picking out people who are going to do bad. Jesse does have his internal demons and his emotional intensity for his ex-wife, neither one will let the other move-on. It's Jesse's emotional drama with his ex-wife and drinking that are his vices. That part gets a little boring; but when you love someone, you just can't let go. Jesse's too patient or to pathetic in the love department.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"After reading the reviews on this item, it seemed it may be what we needed. I have a six year old lab that just needs a 'reminder' not to go into the living room at night to sleep on the couch. The reviews on this said it wasn't sturdy enough to keep a dog from pushing it over but it seemed it would work for what we needed it for.Turns out, just opening and closing the gate is too much activity for this item. It had broken pieces on day two. It won't even stay open all the way now by itself, I have to prop a laundry basket beside it. We don't have toddlers and the dog does not lean on it, just opening it and closing it once a day was too much. I rarely ever leave feedback on items but this is a must. Don't waste your time or money.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of East meets West was much better executed in Red Sun (1972) starring Charles Bronson & Toshiro Mifune. The one star rating is for the awful DVD transfer you are getting. The source material must have been a poor quality VHS copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. If you are a die hard Eli Wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. To everybody else,I recommend waiting for a better quality DVD release that will do this movie justice. Better yet, give ""Red Sun"" a try.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I wonder what kind of reception GWTW would have gotten had it come out in 1945 and been about a love affair between a man and woman in Nazi Germany. Imagine Rhett Butler as the dashing U-boat captain who constantly evades those pesky British destroyers in the North Atlantic. Picture Scarlett O'hara as the totally self-absorbed Fraulein who can't quite figure out what is in all those trains leaving town for central Europe because she is too busy thinking about a party dress. Despite the cinematic qualities of the film - which are undeniable - I cannot get past the fact that it romanticizes a society based on an evil institution. Achtung, darling, I don't give a damn.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This movie was ""okay"" but if I hadn't been from Hawaii, I doubt if it would have held my interest. If you are from Hawaii, don't expect all the characters to be authentic - seems like they had mainland actors trying to act like locals. The acting and the script were sub-par. Fortunately, I watched on TV so I could turn away whenever the racing part was not on. Who wants to watch typical adolescent conversations if they can avoid it? This is one of those stupid PG movies that will not hold an adult's interest but they throw in some bad words and a middle finger so you wouldn't want your kids to watch it.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I love this movie! The story line, the actors, the music are all excellent! This movie/play was created during the time when the Vietnam War was slowly coming toward an end.The songs compliment the political atmosphere in that era, and they certainly fit in today with what has been going on in D.C. for the past eight years. Yes, I'm including both Congress and the White House, ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve, not one thing is ever solved"" fits what has been going on with Democrats and Republicans to a 'T'.Speaking of ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve"" the only disappointment I have with this DVD is that the diector didn't include the full version of the song. You can find the full version on the CD of ""1776"" but not on this DVD.Other than that, excellent movie!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Length:: 1:12 MinsI gave it a good shot, I tried with it for several hours to try to make it work properly, but it was to no avail. I used the provided power supplies and wireless adapter that it came with along with every combination of dip-switch settings on the camera and possible position of the knob on the receiver with nothing better than a very irritating noise from the audio and an extremely choppy and unable to be made out image from the video - this was at only 24 feet away with no obstructions. Then I tried even closer (see the posted video) at less than 7 feet with no obstructions and still had a terrible picture and sound.

TONE_POLARITY,"After seeing the first Saw I was so looking forward to this one. But I had my worries. I loved the first one, but unfortunatly this doesnt come to the standards of the original. I have noticed how people have compared the original Saw to the film Cube with its similarities. Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it. People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second. Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this. Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films. Saw is NOT a slasher film. Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out. Its like they just want to get this film over with. Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it. Not half as good as the ending to the original. Overall, Saw 2 isnt rubbish. It just seems a little pointless.",,0

My Victorinox Swisstool Spirit doesn't have a clip on it and I'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. I have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.It has a different feel than my Swiss but I can already see how amazing it will be. The Swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the Leatherman Charge TTi just looks mean. The blades on the Leatherman are wicked and the best they offer.

When I'm overheated, my face is very red and blotchy. My skin is also extremely sensitive to chemicals, so I have to be careful about what products I use on it. I keep this spray can in my fridge and after a workout or a hot shower, I spray this mist on and it feels amazing. You can see it dew up on your skin for a few moments and it calms down my skin by about 50% immediately.

So, I picked this up, and it is very handy.

At least, they weren't with mine. However, I poked around online and found that they're available for download off this website:http://mllc.utsa.edu/troika/student/mp3.htmI don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those MP3s will be invaluable.",,1

I could hardly put the book down until I was finished.From the first paragraph the reader is transported back in time to 19th century Nantucket into the world of Moby Dick's Captain Ahab and the woman who falls love with him. With an impeccable depiction of the period, Louise M. Gouge walks us through the dusty streets of two whaling communities and into the lives of these fictional, but realistic characters.Hannah Rose, the viewpoint characer, is a woman who transcends time, a woman we easily identify with, a strong woman who goes after her dreams and faces life with honesty and courage, somewhat reminiscent of Ida in Cold Mountain.Meanwhile, the person of Captain Ahab, as seen through the eyes of love, takes on new and intriguing dimensions which make you want to brush off your copy of Moby Dick and read it all over again.",,1

This force has a name and it's Tommy Henriksen. From the worldly sounds and hip-hop beat of the opening track ""If I Could"", to the atmospheric and emotion-drenched ender ""Heaven Only Knows"" this cd is the soundtrack to a culture in metamorphosis. But all the while maintaining a fresh pop sensibility, the songs are just so damn catchy- try getting them out of your head. Quite a feat, and especially for a new artist. Where has this guy been? Suggested tracks for surreal ear candy, the blissful ""Beyond Life"" [with cameo by avant-rocker Nina Hagen], ""Dreaming in Colors"", and the African chant-anthem ""Uneasy Street"".

I also found problems with having to continually go back into the Bluetooth Pref in order to wake the mouse after the computer went to sleep and was re-activated, but did not pursue a fix since the performance was sub-par anyhow.

The remaining chapters are covered in another manual...that's where the above problems are thrown into plain view. In the second solution manual, some answers don't match, are missing, or wrong. For example, chapter 13 has two sections that are flipped around, which shows the haste in bringing out this book. I have nothing good to say about these texts.

I expect that some readers will find the sections on euthanasia distasteful, but the subject is handled carefully and smartly.For all his faults, Kevorkian is a strong and articulate voice who is too often written off automatically as a crank and a murderer.

The nice thing about Somers over Atkins is that it allows you to eat fruit and other good foods. Atkins is too restrictive in that area and you get bored with what you can eat. Not so with Somers.

I have a mostly unfounded fascination for contemporary cultural images of piracy, and I wanted to get this under my belt to earn a little street cred. Turns out, it's amazing. It took me a couple of chapters to pick up the rhythm and vocabulary of Stevenson's style, but once I was able to focus on the story itself, I didn't want it to end. Stevenson does a brilliant job of portraying pirates for the criminals that they were, mostly by viewing them through the eyes of an innocent young boy, who overhears a dark conversation while hiding in an apple barrel and also spends a tense scene trying to escape his home with his mother before the bad guys materialize out of the misty night to kill them both for treasure.

As you might expect based on the price, the Oster is in a class above when compared to the clipper kits you buy at the local Rite-Aid or WalMart. It's a quality appliance and seems to be well worth the extra expense for regular clipper users.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Two reasons. One, it doesn't come with the numbered plastic combs--you have to purchase them separately. Second, it's on the heavy side and it's a bit cumbersome to use compared to the lighter, cheaper models.

It starts right into the movie, with the panning down into the city, and the only bit of the wonderful intro song is a short verse at the end. Maybe most people won't mind, but having seen the VHS every christmas for several years, it's a shame really. But the entire movie is there unedited.

TONE_POLARITY,"We are very happy with our TRU446 phones by Uniden and wanted a third ""cheaper"" phone just to have around, so we went with Uniden again. The EXI44246C model has terrible range, static when even right next to the base. The volume does not seem to be loud enough - at maximum volume, it sounds more like low volume.I do like that the vm indicator is on the base instead of the handset, since we hardly ever replace our phones on the bases, and don't think to look for the handsets to see if there is a vm. This particular base is right by our door so we know right away if there is a vm.I only paid about $20 for this phone, but I'm going to try to return it because it doesn't even seem to be worth that much.",,0

This worked fine but seemed time consuming and my hands got tired. After reading many online reviews of different manual pumps I finally bought this one.I'm VERY impressed! On the first use I pumped 3 ounces in barely 3 minutes! The letdown feature worked nicely and once I had letdown the milk flowed into the bottle. Its compact and very quiet which I love because if I'm out noone needs know I am pumping. Taking it apart for cleaning is simply and quickOverall, I'm tickled pink that I took the plunge again and am extremely satisfied with this purchase.

She conveys AND evokes exactly what one would feel if they were in the song's situation beautifully without incorporating cheesy cliches often found in ""down and out, love gone wrong"" songs.The song I most identify with is Satellite. I think the lyrics to this song are BRILLIANT.Some have mentioned that the lyrics on most of the album are depressing. Well, YEAH. Don't artists write what they are feeling at times?

TONE_POLARITY,"Jeff Shaara's GODS AND GENERALS is a very fine book. However, as has probably been said at least two hundred times in the reviews, its not at the level of his father's THE KILLER ANGELS. Part of the problem is that Jeff Shaara is limited in his choices on who to develop on the Union side that will bring both continuity and yet freshness to this prequel of THE KILLER ANGELS. Hancock is the obvious choice, but the Chamberlain is a mistake. It feels forced and flat. On the flip side, however, the choice of Jackson is inspired and easily the best storyline in the book.Despite the criticisms, still a very worthwhile book.",,1

Ya, I liked the Beatles---with all their pretension---and all that, until I heard the Brothers D and then I realized that there is one man who figured it ALL out 30 years ago. I mean the reason rock intellectuals describe Ray Davies as a genius is beacuse he is!... The back to basics production and beautiful melodies make the Village Green essential listening! I just wish they'd make this album in closed caption, because then we'd all have world peace!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As an experienced calculus student who sometimes (or sometimes a LOT of times) needed a nice brief study guide to help iron out some calculus concepts - I found this book to be quite frustrating to use. The night before the big exam, you DO NOT want to be reading about a bunch of weirdos talking about the simplest derivatives and limits. You need to be doing problems, and looking at more examples. This book is a waste of precious study time and I would never tell anyone to buy it unless they need material explained to them in silly story form. I recommend Schuams Calculus or REA's Problem Solvers for Calculus which contain wonderfully brief reviews, no corny filler, and lots of in depth problems with solutions.",,0

Word of warning: if you start to upload any CD which wants to install something called Quick Time (it's a player like Flash) - stop right there, remove the CD, re-package the CD, and try to get your money back. I have no idea if Body Works is any good because once Quick Time installed, it wouldn't let me install the program I bought the CD for. The same thing happened with another CD I purchased (which I also want to review to provide the same warning to potential customers); once the Quick Time was installed (in the case of the second CD, it was already installed), I couldn't install the program I bought the CD for.

TONE_POLARITY,"""Hostage to War"" gives a great understanding of the conditions that the prisions of forced labor camps and concentration camps went through. It is the true story of Tatjana Wassiljewa, who was 13 years old when the Germans separated her from her mother and younger sister. She was sent off to a forced labor camp where she suffered horribly under Hitler's vicious rule. She experienced things that are just mind boggling. Starvation, illness, and so much more. It shows how hard it was to grow up during World War II and survive. Tatjana was a true survivor and went on to become a teacher during her twentys. It was an interesting book if you would like to learn more about World War II.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I bought this CD when it just came out last year (so I ain't got the bonus tracks) and happened to listen again to it recently so thought of posting a review. This CD is not as good as their previous 'All Rise' partly because of the high expectations that fans and listeners alike have put on their second CD. The first few tracks on this CD is neither greater nor stronger compared to the songs on 'All Rise' (they're about the same) but it gets too weak and unbearable to listen after 'Don't Treat Me Like A Fool'. I liked 'All Rise' too much to be able to listen to this too much. (Lifespan in my CD player: around 2 weeks; 'All Rise': 1 month +),,1

TONE_POLARITY,Alfred Hitchcock - The Legend Begins is a great way to own some of the first films that Hitchcock ever directed. I purchased this at my local Walmart for $5 and it has been one of the best investments i've made in a long time. Specifically because The 39 Steps was on this collection made it all worthwhile. The quality of the discs are very good and the films themselves are well presented. 20 movies on 4 discs is a great value and the films are outstanding. Pick this one up.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this book to assist in staff training. I have found it to contain useful information. However, after the first chapter, it tends to repeat itself without introducing much new helpful information. There are lots of checklists for staff self-evaluations that, when scored, do not include information on improving their weak areas. Also, as this book was written for the UK, I have found the language to be interesting, but a slight drawback. There is quite a bit of UK slang (such as tatty, taken out of a skip, put a tick in the appropriate column, etc.). And there was an interesting, but not so useful for the US, chapter on British Telecom.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This is the story of a former child prodigy who begins to lose his ability as he matures. We meet him as adult, who is teaching music at a college, and still longing to recover his previous ability. One day, he is summoned for jury duty and becomes involved in a murder case involving a young mentally ill man and his Zen teacher. He also becomes romantically involved with one of the jurors. At the same time, the narrator begins teaching a promising Korean boy who shows signs of being a prodigy. Salzman weaves all these threads into a deft, intriuging web about what it means to have talent and what it means to be human, although the book drags a little at the end, it is well worth the read.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"By all means this is not a bad album. In fact, if they had never produced anything else, it would be amazing. However, Bardo Pond have always been trailblazers in the realm of psychedelic rock, each album contributing new sounds to their bag of tricks. I remember being amazed at how many changes and variations occured on Dilate, and yet they still managed to have a consistent, whole sound. Popping in Ellipse, I found myself bored as track after track provided nothing that hadn't been thoroughly explored by the group in previous outings. Indeed, it seems like they took the first track off Dilate and multiplied it six times, each track starting on a mellow riff and building to a loud, emotional finish. I'll give them that its their most consistent sounding recording to date, but I feel that it results in a stagnant, repetitive and unimaginative album.

King Arthur, being an all-round Kingly sort of fellow, would never have been so wantonly ignorant of ornithology, and to imply this was so is a gross insult. I also found it grossly offensive to limbless knights, grenade-throwing monks, and other minorities. I was watching with a three-headed ogre friend, and she literally burst into tears at the stereotyped protrayal of her race. (Three heads, that was a lot of tears to clean up.)

If you are looking for a good self-improvement book that teaches you how to positively deal with, accept, and/or affect changes in your life, please pass this one and invest in Brian Tracy's ""Maximum Achievement"".

TONE_POLARITY,"I thought this game was brilliant and played it incessantly; frequently staying up until the early hours of the morning driven by the intoxicating adventure. There's no real need for me to mention the graphic because it's all been said before but the attention to detail is such that the sun rises and sets changing the landscape hues accordingly. The levels are incredably diverse in creatures, noises, tasks etc that you can't wait to get to the next stage to experience more. Another good thing about the game is that, in addition to running around overcoming monsters etc, it requires stratagy and stealth. Sometimes the tasks are too much to solve and you really need to look at some gaming hints to get on. I cant wait until Nintendo release another Zelda game - I though it was so good. So good, in fact, that I haven't bought many more games since because I can't find one that compares.",,1

Instead of arousing interest, I was thinking, ""How lame, enough already."" Secondly, the plot was very busy, which necessitated the author quickly wrapping up all the loose ends at the end of the book. However, these two problems were relatively minor, and I could recommend this book heartily.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"To say it's Sherlock Holmes would be enough except for this 20 word limit imposed by Amazon :-). If you're a lover of classic mystery stories, as I am, this book will be a delight. The collection contains stories as chronicled by Sherlock Holmes' able bodied assistant James Watson, The mysteries are always intriguing to Holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner. Once you begin to read you will be taken back to old England in a time where the world was just beginning to use science as a means of development rather than warfare and chivalry was still alive and kicking, this book is a must read for all you book lovers!!",,1

I had just picked up Morty from the nursing home and wheeled him in to see herbie. You see we fist made out to the original Herbie movie and thought we could recapture some of that zing. We must have gone into the wrong theater but it was too late to wheel morty out once the film started so we wouldn't bother everyone...I shouldn't have taken Morty to see it, at one part he screamed so hard his falsies flew out and smacked a young man's head in the seat in front of him.

TONE_POLARITY,I have almost finished this book and it is an easy read and very informative. I was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The young should be taught true history. The author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the Nazis actions and the evils of the Russian Revolution. I know we have been allies of France in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. It was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. Evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. God bless the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution. We could learn much from the way they lived and died for their Catholic beliefs.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"'Hard-Boiled', an anthology of twentieth-century ""hard-boiled"" short stories compiled by Pronzini and Adrian, should have been great. Unfortunately out of the thousands of stories to choose from they picked the dregs from some of the best writers (Ellroy, Goodis, Thompson, ..), and the best from a great many (deservedly) unknown writers. It took me a long time to slog through the dozens of stories contained in this volume.However the only positve aspect of the book are the commentaries before each story, giving a bit of background on each author and their placement in the history of 'hard-boiled' short fiction. Clearly Pronzini/Adrian have done their homework in this regard. But this only made me more frustrated with the all the mediocre stories they amassed.Bottom line: a missed opportunity. Very disappointing.",,0

My search was for a comb that is going to last without having to replace it every year because the tines started breaking, and I believe this one is going to last.It's stainless steel and it combs through most junk dogs, even little dogs, get on their faces. Mine is a Maltese, for instance, so he's got the brown stuff from his eyes that white dogs get and this comb gets through the gunk without too much fuss, especially if I spray it slightly first to wet it a little.The Christensen line is expensive but the quality is there and the tools are made to last.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This band seems to be unknown to most people. I believe they officially changed thier name to Magnolia Electric Co. after this disc. This was the first disc I heard from this group. I instantly liked the disc. I sought out older discs by Songs:Ohia and found more great music, but they seemed to be paving the way for this record. The music has sort of a country/alt rock type sound that is hard to classify. Jason Molina lead vocals have a unique sound with great lyrics. There is a sense of sadness to most of the tracks, but the album is not a downer as most songs also seem to have a few lines expressing some type of hope or longing.Simply put, I really like this disc and I always will wonder why a group with such a great sound goes somewhat unknown",,1

But this film was the biggest waste of money, time and energy I have ever encountered. I guess they thought that if they marketed it as 'Bram Stoker's Mummy' that it might have the same shelf appeal as the Dracula re-release. It doesn't. It is trash. The actors are trash. The script is trash. The special effects would have been trash too if the production crew had decided to pool a few bucks together to give the film any.

TONE_POLARITY,"Crawl into the cozy of the Cotswalds with Agatha Raisin, who makes her debut as unorthodox heroine to the menopausal set. Taking a well earned early retirement to the village of Carsley, Agatha tries to adapt her presumptuous and pushy personality to the cozy and contentious community life. Aggressive Agatha is clueless in the deportment department, but determined to fit into her imagined idyllic retirement at any cost. And never imagines that the store bought quiche she enters into the village cooking contest will kill someone. Agatha's allure lies in her complete lack of tact and charm, her assertive aplomb, shrewd intellect, rude responses, and the little glimpses the reader is permitted of the human Agatha. The scenery is splendidly sketched, the cast of characters outrageous but somehow believable, and this middle aged mama's only complaint is that this book ends all too quickly - but hold on - this is a series, and more Agatha awaits.",,1

Parker, on the set, is a minimalist in that he has stripped his set to the bare essentials. On top of that, his actual playing on the set is drumming as it should be - he lays down a funky riff to support some fantastic side musicians. On top of this, Parker explores different modes of expression through percussion, such as his body and voice. The CD contains inspired playing by Parker and all musicians, but also contains amazing ensemble work. I highly reccommend this.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Though I usually don't write reviews, I thought it worthwhile to point out the problem I had with this product: It no longer has enough suction to get the water from the floor into the receptacle. Instead it would suck up water for a bit, then deposit it somewhere else in a puddle. I can't return it since the warranty has expired; I was the only one in the household using it, and I usually didn't have floor duty, so it didn't see all that much use. I cleaned all the parts I could get to; I suspect that somewhere along the suction route something has degraded or broken loose. Given the other reviews here of this nature, I don't really wish to spend more money getting it fixed, though, so back to mops I go!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"From Depeche Mode to Yaz to Erasure, everything Vince Clarke touches turns to gold. This compilation provides all the evidence necessary to bestow upon Clarke the title ""synth god"".The biggest hits are ""Little Respect"" and ""Who Needs Love (Like That)"", but each song stands on its own as a great New Wave composition, based on the powerful and unique vocals of Andy Bell and the fantastic synthesizer soundscapes (all 100% analog!) of Clarke.""Victim of Love"" (my fave), ""Oh L'Amour"", and ""Stop!"" are other highlights on this CD, which is well worth the money for any fan of 80s music.One other note: Erasure has had several albums after the release of this compilation (most notably the masterpiece ""I Say, I Say, I Say"", in 1994), so ""Pop! 20 Hits"" cannot be said to be representative of their career as a whole. Still, it's worth owning for its summary of the band's first decade of production.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I received this as a birthday present. I first tried making a loaf of honey wheat bread and followed the instructions from the manual. I was happy with how easy it was....I was unhappy with the results. Basically after the cycle was over, I was presented with a soggy brick of half dough/half undercooked bread. It was inedible and I basically wasted a bunch of ingredients. I thought maybe it was just a first time around mistake on my part and decided I'd give it another shot. I made the easiest possible recipe and once again I wasted 4 cups of flour plus all of the other ingredients on a soggy half baked lump of dough that had to go in the trash. I've never had a brand new machine just not work at all. It was really disappointing. If you're thinking of buying this bread maker I urge you not to.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Mary Wilson has provided valuable information about the Supremes, but particularly Florence Ballard, showing that Ballard was not a loser, but a very talented woman, frustrated by the world of business.

A must read for any course on music history.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. Endless long face shots of Schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. Occasional humor and the interest generated by Paltrow and Hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.A 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,Paltrow's pathetic outfits and Hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. Michael Rappaport and that Bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.As I review the film in my mind, Two stars might have been too high!

TONE_POLARITY,"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""Angel"" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I saw the ""Picasso"" play in Laguna Beach, and was disappointed. I'm a Steve Martin fan, and a fan of the theater. But, frankly, this seemed like a play that was written by a TV gag man (Martin wrote the old ""Smothers Brothers"" show.) It was very very two-dimensional, considering its intellectual pretentions. Frankly, I think Martin is a first rate comedic actor, and stand-up comedy writer and performer. But the only screenplay he wrote that was good was ROXANNE, and that was good because he just updated--and did a twist on--""Cyrano De Bergerac."" He is NOT good at long narrative fiction. He's good--often brilliant-- at small bytes (which is why PURE DRIVEL is good). He should stick to what he does best.",,0

What are the cardboard names of the Princesses for? No instructions for that either. In our opinion for 40.00 + shipping you should be given more instructions.

This films starts off well and had me interested for most of its duration, but it was let down by a barely coherent ending that, after 36 hours of thinking about it, I still don't get. Based on the plot summary, you might think that this is a Christian propaganda film, but it's not. It's just a normal film with some religious themes, except the religious ideas put forward in this film are so confused, that I'm not even sure what the writer's beliefs actually are. Unless you too can manage to find a ridiculously cheap copy of this film, I wouldn't bother.",,0

I told myself, that as soon as I felt up to working out, I would start this program.Three weeks after my surgery, I started working out and eating better using the guidelines in the Body for Life book. After two weeks on the program, I have lost 8 lbs. and am feeling great!Now, mind you... I have to work out with a neck brace on and have had to work around my injury as not to damage the work that the doctor did in December. But to date, I have had no problems...

TONE_POLARITY,"This Breadmaker was purchased to replace an old one which had simply worn out over several years of use. My wife has found it to be easy to use and very efficient in baking bread. Although it took several attempts to get use to the new model, because the instructions were different from the old maker, once she became used to the new one it was as easy or easier to use than the previous model. While we could not say it is an improvement over the other brand name it most certainly is as good and easy to use. One good feature is that it bakes the bread much quicker than the previous breadmaker. It runs very quietly, much quieter than the other unit,and you hardly know it is working.The cost of this new unit was very reasonable for the work it does and we consider it a good purchase.While not having it long enough to attest to the Sunbeam's longivity, so far it is operating as advertised and we are very pleased with the product.",,1

You either LOVE it, or are very creeped out by it...I'm sorry gals, but a mother sneaking into her grown son's house and crawling across the floor in a darkened room sounds more like stalking, than unconditional love.I have read it a few times to my daughter and she likes it good enough. Of course, she is a kid, she likes EVERYTHING I read to her. Seen through her eyes, it is just a story.

The only regret about this CD is it doesn't include the lovely ballad ""Once In A While"" (which was, incidentally, cut from the film). In my opinion, that was one of the best songs.

Or you can ignore the ""advice"", use 16 gauge wiring (this is usually the 100ft cords you can buy everywhere) and take your chances on shortening the life of the mower.

TONE_POLARITY,"Okay, I don't necessarily buy into all of Trent Reznor's lyrics (""God is dead, and no one cares...""), but poetry aside, this album deserved all of the critical acclaim it received. The Nine Inch Nail composed what I consider to be one of the best albums of the 1990's, and Reznor shows that Industrial music is not just out there to be danced to. Nine Inch Nails uses a superb mixture of high-reverb guitars, keyboards, sound effects and beats to portray a spectrum of emotional highs and lows compressed into a flow which I feel is on par with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon."" Reznor packs a hard and noisy whallop on the first half of the album which reaches a climax with the song ""Big Man With A Gun"". After this, things slow down dramatically until the final song ""Hurt"" hits you with one big, depressing knockout punch. The feeling conveyed on ""The Downward Spiral"" is phenomenal, and it's a must-buy for alternative and hard-rock junkies alike.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This is, to me, one of KISS's finest releases. As I've grown up I've heard too many people bad mouth KISS and I call these people ""musical snobs"". They tend to listen only to things like progressive rock. I like KISS because they played from the heart. Yes, the music is not be technically superb in most ways but they did have some very original ideas on this CD like the guitar playing of Ace Frehely and the little boy voice- very cute. One of the finer songs on the CD is ""Hard Luck Woman"" written by Peter Criss. Peter is a terrific drummer. He's no Carl Parlmer but then Carl Palmer was no Peter Criss. If you like hard rock and want to add to your audial history from that repertoire then you may just want to get a hold of this CD.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"...that self titled albums are a band's best. While this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut ""Up the Bracket"". However, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, Pete Doherty and Carl Bart. This tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, ""Can't Stand Me Now"".I think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if I could only buy one Libertines' album, this would not be it.",,1

However, I had great difficulty putting this book down to work or sleep. I found the characters and plot most riveting.

Once they get too challanging you realize that your doing the same exact stuff as you were doing on teh first mission, just a lot faster. The cops have to intelligence at all, they just go directly at your car. The game is a MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY. I reccomend using your money wisely on something like Onimusha, that's a great game with better graphics, gameplay, plot, and variety. Don't waste your money or time. I am aware that this review is on the contrary to most of the others, but I feel that you should take my advice. After two complete hours of gameplay I was bored out of my mind",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment. This ""game"" is really hard to call a game. It's more like one long reading exercise. Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again. Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to ""unlock"" the game. Then in order to play the ""game"" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the ""game"" and then try to explain it to my son. I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock. Buyers beware!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is. I'm sure most of us have at some time or another laughed at the misfortunate medical circumstances of others as represented on film. But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs.",,0

""Atari"" is probably my favorite song because it says so much about my life. ""Driver"" is also a great song to listen to especially while you are driving.

I love it and recomend it to everyone who still have a doubt on buying this, it's gratious and has also the hard guitars that are on the Live Through This as well.

When I got to Spenceville, I was captivated with it at the beginning, but as the story went on, I found myself somewhat bored with the all too ""predictable"" plot. It was still a cute story but a little too ""feel-good"" ending for me. The characters are easy to identify with but it is hard to create any real ""attachement"" to them because of their ""whishy-washyness"".

By paralleling the recorded history of the times and the written word of the gospels we are ably guided to concur with the author that the apocalypse is a fait accompli. The bible and gospels should be understood not with the modern accepted meaning of the word but that of the meaning in use at the time of the writing.

I've seen her BLONDE AMBITION and GIRLIE SHOW tours (on video) before so I was ready for this one. I have to say that much of it is hype. It was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. The costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. Madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. The bull ride that she did in ""don't tell me/human nature"" was way too short. It wasn't even worth mentioning. Some people described the geisha themed segment as ""awesome"" and ""magical"" but I found it to be OK at best. She flew across the stage.. BIG DEAL. She did an air spin like a scene out of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... cool. I thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. And what the heck was up with that anime video thing?

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this lock in November after our second trailer had been stolen (they cut thru the padlocks). At that time our trailer was buried in snow and ice and we couldnt see the wheels much less put this lock on a wheel. We got a melt in early March, I handed it to my husband to put it on the trailer and he came back in and said ""where are the keys?"" There were no keys to this thing. I would expect the keys would have been taped to the lock but they werent. I contacted the company with several emails to get a set of keys but they NEVER RESPONDED. So all we got is a very expensive door stop. PFFFFFFT. Lousy company who deserves to go belly up in this economy because they dont care about their customer.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"My 5 year old son just loves this playset, my husband also loves to play it with him. It is so cool, there is one section where you clear the path for the airplanes to land, (you are driving a snowplow). Another part where you have to feed all of the animals, which is really a lot of fun.I did buy Tonka Monster Trucks CD that is supposed to be compatible with the Digs n Rigs playset but the requirments differ, so if you do buy another CD, be sure it will work on your system, I thought if D&R;'s worked, so would the compatible CD-wrong!:)Overall, the BEST CD/Playset my children have and they have a lot! :)",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"What a lump of coal...Written in a style that seems more interested in a company-centric style, this diatribe ode to corporate short sited bottom lines, takes a wishful thinking view on the wholesale and retail process of sending tens of thousands of jobs out of the country.The author gives brief lip service to the human tolls this process takes, always setting up a verbal best case scenario that includes more and better local jobs mystically appearing for the displaced workers this effects.Hey Tom, on the real world this process has led to double digit unemployment across the country. Take a reality check and pull your head out of your 5th point of contact.Congratulations to all the companies that have shaved a few points off the bottom line at the cost of their US former employees, and the long term well being of the country that sends out young men and women out to fight and die keeping you free.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I attended a lecture the author gave summarizing his book. If you're interested in globalization, the environment, or any other global problems, I highly recommend reading this book.

TONE_POLARITY,We waited this long for this? A movie that not only does not make a heap of sense but is a major let down in the most profound sense of the word. Its seems to me that the Wachowski Brothers only concentrated on the special effects but forgot about writing a compelling plot to go with it. The mythology that made the first Matrix such a classic is thrown out for an incoherent cyber juke of a story that not only insults the legion of fans but makes them look stupid for waiting around for theses sequels.The Wachowski Brothers should be a shame of themselves for ripping off the fans of the first movie.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Eagle Han plays a ming lord planning to bring down shaolin temple and rule china. Two young students one from shaolin and another a student of tai chi join forces to stop him before it's too late. The two young men find out that they have more in common then they ever imagined before, and that they were more closely connected to the Evil killer then they would ever have wanted. Breath taking fight scenes, Great Drunken staff showcased, and some great Tai chi kung fu aswell. Eagle Han is again a great villian. Gotta see this one.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I loved this CD. I bought it when it hit stores and listened to it for weeks. I love how everything kinds flows together all the tracks and songs, with just subtle differences.

TONE_POLARITY,"It's incompatible with my MacLinkPlus; everything must become Appleworks 5 before it can then be translated into AW6 and the same thing works in reverse. I can't cut & past text from my old fave WordPerfect for Mac. And it's the slowest somemabitch, at least in iMac X+, that I've ever had the impatience to work with. Spinning wheel: working, working, working, all right already: finish working! It's basically sound, but I can't call up the usually codes to see what is really going on, as I could with WordPerfect. Its translation to html is a nice attempt but full of hesitancies, mistranslations, & that goddamned eternal spinning wheel: processeing, processing. I really think I *could* like this word process if they fixed up the speed, efficiency, & translatability, & added the ""seeing within"" features I like.

I followed the directions on how to use the new razor, and all I got out of it was a nice facial massage. The razor seemed like it did not have any cutting blades in it. I pulled my skin tight and the razor just rode over facial hair like it was not there. To put it simply, the razor does not cut my beard. The razor is a sad disappointment. It looks good, fits my hand well, it just wont cut my beard.",,0

First off the remote control range is no 100' it is like 20' at max, second I can hardly hear it at 20' away so how is a coyote going to here it from any further lol. This is very disapointing buy and feel miss lead on the discription. Save you money and dont buy this. However Johnny Stewart had great calls just not this one.

TONE_POLARITY,"The only drawback about this book is that it purports to place history in a realistic framework. Some of the material is factual, while other material is heresay or complete rumor.

TONE_POLARITY,"Here's a story of one messed up family, afflicted by a genetic condition that gradually deteriorates the mind and reverts the afflicted to a savage state, behold the Merrye Syndrome. ""The unfortunate result of inbreeding.""Now this movie isn't exactly gore driven, it's more of an eerie creeper that implies alot with out actually showing. Which might anger some of the sadists out there. But it works pretty darn well. The cast is really good, especially Sid Haig. This movie is an obvious precursor to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which should make people want to see it. Besides it has Lon Chaney Jr. in it. What horror fan wouldn't want to see Spider Baby?Great dialogue, uber-creepines, and one sicko story, not much more to ask for in a horror film.""Just because something isn't good doesn't mean it's bad.""""Eating of flesh would hasten the progress of their condition.""""Help me find something sharp.""",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"In her novel, ""Wait For Love,"" Wanda Hudson explores the evolution of one woman blinded by the idea of love - ""I gave into any and everything a man wanted. My life's mission was to have one and make him happy even if I wasn't.""The protagonist, Lynnde, spends her young adulthood in pursuit of love. With a single-minded determination, Lynnde manages to go from one bad relationship (I use the term lightly!) to the next, only finding solace in food. As her emotions run the gamut, so does her weight. Will Lynnde ever find the love she so desperately wants?There is no denying that Hudson knows how to draw readers into a story. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to jump into the pages of this book to either hug or hurt Lynnde. Hudson weaves a story that is both fresh and familiar. I enjoyed ""Wait For Love"" and look forward to reading more from this author.",,1

Intense, exciting, exhilerating, comical, a rush of relief in knowing that the end of the world could be an amazing wonderful experience.This book is everything, philosophical, sociological, psychological, comical, dramatic, and your not-so-common, ""it just made me laugh at loud and feel good"" type of book.My advice?I highly recommend this book, and periodically hanging out in coffee shops to meet really neat people!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Ironically, after having been in the fireplace business for several years, I do not have a fireplace in my home. I have missed not being able to stoke up a fire on a cold and damp day. The Ultimate Fireplace DVD has been an amazing replacement for the real thing. My wife and I are voracious readers so we curl up in our favorite chairs nightly with our latest books in front of the crackling fire. We have two dogs and it is funny how they start to pant when the fireplace DVD is running. It is so realistic that they are sure they must be getting hot. With Christmas around the corner we put on our favorite Christmas music and the Christmas fireplace scene and our home takes on an idyllic presence with us curled up with a steaming cup of tea or hot cider and the dogs resting beside us. Truly a Rockwell moment.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Keyshia obviously represent the great talent we've got here hiding in the bay area. I love her vocals; she's got soul, range and a voice that'll just blow you out of the water. The most popular song on this album seems to be Love, which, I must agree with the most of you, she kills the chours with that up and down range thing. She does sing live LOVELY. Like, you didn't know it was a REAL talent as oppose to synthicizing. She holds a note better than Beyonce can. I look forward to hearing more from here because she is an awsome talent.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I have had two of these so far. The first one leaked when water was filled all the way to the top. Therefore I was only able to fill it up about half way. Soon the lid also broke so that each time I poured water into a cup, the lid would slide off. The second one I got was fine. But every now and then, the black carbon particles would end up in the filtered water. Sometimes the water would taste as though it had not been filtered at all. I rely on this product because it is the only realistic way for me to get filtered water here in my college dorm. I really wish there was another company that made a better product.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,Coldplay is so overhyped it's not even funny. All there songs sound the same.

Note to Chris Martin you're never going to be as big as U2. Never ever. No talent=gone soon.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this product with high hopes after reading the product reviews. Recently spent a ton of money re-landscaping our yard and putting down new grass. As soon as we finished Mr.Mole appeared and started tearing it all up. Reviews here were awesome so I gave the product a try. Used all 6 whole worms. Didn't touch the worn with my fingers or with anything with my scent on it. Found frequently traveled holes to put them in. Waited a week. No results. Mole still lives. Feel like I'm on ""CaddyShack"". The worst thing? Mr.Mole continued to use the tunnels I put the worm in, even pushed the worms out of the tunnel in a dirt pile. 3 of the 6 worm locations resulted in big dirt patches. Moles hunt by finding the vibrations their food gives off when moving... Not sure why I thought an immobile product would work. Time to call the exterminator. Save your money.

If you are any kind of a Linda fan, you want to hear some strong belting, some blast it out of the water renditions of pop, rock, country and folk songs with a West Coast feel.This album is strictly for the parents of newborns who are having trouble getting them to sleep. While Ronstadt's singing here is indeed angelic and soothing, it also could easily induce a coma in the average adult. If you like your Linda bold and brassy, skip it.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading.",,1

The forth song ""Unbound"" is particularly good. The fifth song (Sacrifice) is an unusual Indian convict rap that works. Sometimes I use its lyrics in my daily life (if I have to sacrifice some more...) This must be my favorite Robbie Robertson album, because I listen to it more than any of his others. If you are a Robbie Robertson fan you need this CD.Except for the day I bought this CD, I have never seen it for sale anywhere. Amazon may be the last place left where you can.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This, the second in Bergman's ""Faith"" trilogy, is a dark, brooding tale of a clergyman who has lost his faith in God. Indeed, it is doubtful at all if he ever had it, for his vision of God is quite selfish. The action takes place on a single Sunday in November, where the town pastor (Gunnar Bjornstrand in an excellent performance) is finishing a service in front of a tiny congregation. During this day, the pastor will be forced to examine himself and to try to reach out for some human contact to replace the spiritual depletion within him. Also starring Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom, and Ingrid Thulin as the schoolteacher who unselfishly offers herself to the pastor but is rejected in favor of the memory of his dead wife. This film has a subtle, deeply wrought poetry to it and should be seen by all lovers of intelligent cinema.",,1

I actually found the Prince of Wales (Prince Regent) to be a ruthless snake that was King in ""name only.""There are some great scenes and shots of Windsor Castle, the Houses of Parliament, and St Paul's Cathedral.

I found the musical arrangements wonderful and Russell's renditions of Core'ngrato, Recondita armonia and Vesti la giubba....perfection!! I do, however, agree that it's time for him to rest his voice before he does his 4th CD. 3 CD's in such a short amount of time plus all the promotional trips and personal performances certainly must play havoc on an entertainer's voice.

When you are attaching the plunger and coupler hose, be aware that large end is sealed inside with the piston, but the small end will spill if it isn't held upright when you attach the coupler hose. I was very happy to see that the plunger assembly is entirely made of metal. It only has rubber covers on it.Not sure where it's made, there's no marking I can see. It's a well made injector, though.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Four Tops, the Supremes, Johnny Rivers, and the Four Seasons were highlights of a mediocre DVD. The Tops did a surprisingly short medley of three of their hits. They looked great up there and there were some humorous parts (I thought). The Supremes looked wonderful as well and Diana primped and sang her heart out, but ""My World is Empty Without You"" was a little too happy for the song's mood and I've yet to figure out what the happening of ""The Happening"" is. Johnny Rivers was incredibly stiff and seemed nervous. The song ended rather abruptly. I was impressed by the Four Seasons as well; being able to visualize that nasally sound from Frankie Valli was wonderful.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This book is awesome, the best in the series. It not only shows new innovations in Rowlings magical world that we all love, but goes much beyond this, showing changes and newness in Harry himself.

TONE_POLARITY,"Universal Audio is their masterpiece. I've been a fan since Peleton and have all their albums, so I think I have a bit of perspective. Oddly enough, even though the sound is stripped down from Hate, there so much happening sonically in each song that I unearth new sounds every time I listen. Universal Audio is so good that I can't listen to anything else. It truly bears repeated listening. Album of the year, definitely. Do yourself a favor and get this immediately. Highlights: The City Consumes Us, Sink or Swim, Bits of Bone, Girls of Valour, Keep on Breathing, Now and Forever, Come Undone. It's all good. I get chills when I listen to it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"We have 5 of these. My wife likes them because they are easy and dependable. They don't leave salt or pepper on the table (most important).

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. My only real criticism of the book was that I found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which I loved) to be a touch predictable. Really there was only one of two ways it could go, so I suppose that was unavoidable. BUT, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). The writing was stellar, as you would expect from Gaiman, and the story was quite original. It's like he mashed up The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, put it underneath modern day London, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. I absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. So well done, sir. Well done indeed.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I am convinced that the George Lucas who created the original, unadulterated trilogy was a benevolent, imaginative visionary. With his dismal prequels and an uncanny talent to botch the original trilogy by ""enhancing"" it, I believe that, at some point, a malevolent demiurge usurped licht-Lucas' control of the Star Wars universe and now torments us with exasperating changes. The CGI additions are incongruous with the visual style of the rest of the films; the additional dialogue robs the original films of subtlety (are people so dense that they are incapable of sensing conflict in Darth Vader without him shouting ""NOOOOO!""?); ""Han shot first,"" &c., &c., &c. . . . the list of grievances is too long to share in a brief review.

TONE_POLARITY,"This movie is not perfect, but it has moments of poignant romance and others of absolute hiliarity. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful. This movie is a semi-musical farce. I mean farce in its proper usage: not a term of derision but rather the highest and hardest form of comedy (as distinguished from satire for instance). Or put it this way- Shakespeare-s comdies are farces. Except maybe for the Merry Wives of Windsor. A good farce is very very hard to do. And there are moments when this film descends into Burlesque- and others when the humor gets clunky. Despite its uneveness this is still an immensly entertaining film. Even the minor supporting characters are a hoot (Ed Begley jr and Swoozie Kurts as the parents of our haplessly infatuated hero, for instance).",,1

Then I purchased the second book and found it to be worse in the proofreading department. I'm not sure if this is because of its conversion to Kindle or if those errors were in the original text. These are the kinds of errors that really detract from the reading experience and take one out of the story. Makes me wonder if these books were rushed to publication without a qualified editor. I probably will not purchase the third one for that reason.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Set in the 1960s in a fictional department store in Sydney, this delightful book is pitch perfect.The story focuses on the women working in Ladies' Cocktail Frocks and in Ladies' Evening Frocks sections of the store. The demarcation relates not only the class of customer, but also to the Aussies (Mrs Williams, Fay and Miss Baines, Patty) in Cocktail Frocks and the very Continental Magda in Evening Frocks. Enter Lesley/Lisa, a naive young thing doing a short stint during the holidays after completing her Leaving Certificate.We learn a little of their private lives and aspirations, and the attitudes of the time (especially how men and women relate to each other, and the education of women) are spot on.If you didn't live through this era, this book will make you feel as though you did. And for those of us who DID live through it, it is a wonderful time capsule - but with the addition of sophisticated wit and humour. Very good",,1

I have slow-growing, fine hair, so I only need to use it every 3-4 weeks.

TONE_POLARITY,"I think this album is terrible. Not musically, but just as a matter of taste. It is much slower and more trebly than the black metal I usually prefer. however, it is really evil sounding and displays a lot of musical talent. So my review serves to inform, not to critique. Honestly, everybody has different tastes in music and metal, so I'm just trying to help people potentially avoid my mistake. The other reviews on here didn't really paint a good picture of the sound and I bought it thinking it would be fast and viking-esque. Anyway, it's mostly really slow and heavy, with a lot of echo and haunting vocals. So, if you can imagine a slow version of Mayhem's ""Wolf's Lair Abyss"" CD (really, really, slow, that is), that is KIND OF a good idea what this sounds like.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have been listening to David Arkenstone's music since ""Valley in the Clouds"" was released, and I have to say that the last couple of albums have shown a sharp downturn in the creativity and originality which once hallmarked David's music. ""Caravan of Light"" is the worst sort of ""new age"" music; the musical structure is trite and the borrowings from the musics of other cultures is, at best, pretentious. Gone is the sense of openness and wonder which characterised ""Valley in the Clouds"" and ""Another Star in the Sky"" and adventurousness of ""In the Wake of the Wind"" and ""Quest of the Dream Warrior.""There is one small, beautiful gem, however. Track 3, ""The Jade Mountain,"" is an understated and lovely performance. It gives one a glimpse of David's true creative depths, which are otherwise sublimated by the bland, generic offerings of ""Caravan of Light."" For an introduction to the REAL David Arkenstone, I recommend the other albums noted in this review.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I first read ""Zen Flesh, Zen Bones"" 13 years ago, and the stories within the ""101 Zen Stories"" section have been with me throughout the years! No matter what religion you are, no matter what age, these stories WILL change your life, and the way you respond to and see the world around you. You'll chuckle, you'll frown, and you'll wish there were 1001 Zen Stories to read instead of only 101... I hope you'll read this book and enjoy it as much as I do! I'm willing to bet you'll keep it on the nearest bookshelf, and open it often :}",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"That moment when your doctor tells you that you have a condition no one you know has ever heard of, it has no cure, and will likely only continue to get worse. But you have the name of the evil monster under your bed, keeping you up at night and haunting you all day. With that name buy this book, buy several, give them to your family and close friends. It is hard for you and impossible for them to go through this but understanding it will make things so much easier",,1

I've been in sales for 10 years...after listening to this material from Roger Dawson I realized that I wasn't a good negotiator, I was a serial caver...I would give in on just about everything. This course teaches you the skills to get to a win win situation without having to cave on every point. It also helps you understand what people are trying to do to you during the negotiation and helps you overcome these points. Great material.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this for my son who was 4 at the time. I thought it would be a cool thing for him to see nature and how it works. Well, we got the tank and it should be for adults only! Because it is sooo flimsy!! The top comes off too easily!! Then we waited 4 months for the teadpoles to even come. They survived two days!!! We were so dissapointed. After buying the tank and then having to buy the tadpoles I thought it was wrong to charge us for the tadpoles in the first place!! So we ended up going to the river nearby and catching our own. That was very fun. The tadpoles lasted about a month...then I decided back to the river they go beacause it STUNK sooo bad!! It was stinking up the house. All in all it was more trouble then it was worth. Save your money...Buy a regular aquarium and an adult frog at the pet store.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Martin Duberman's classic text has been revamped in an expanded first paperback edition by South End Press. This new edition is especially noteworthy for its three new chapters: ""The State of Gay Studies,"" ""Queer Economic Justice,"" and ""Jewish Radicals, Effeminacy, and the Rise of Gay Chauvinism,"" in which Duberman takes a critical look at the phenomenon of self-laudatory gay studies. Whether you are interested in gay studies, philosophy, radical studies, or if you're simply a humanitarian, this book is a must read.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Not being a fan of the usual election campaign books, I took this up with low expectations. I just wanted to know something about Ronald Reagan's first campaign for governor. I also suspected that it would be something of a hatchet job on RR. To my pleasant surprise, Matthew Dallek has produced an engaging--even exciting--narrative that is very well balanced. Though he does tend to laud the ""responsible liberalism"" of Edmund ""Pat"" Brown, the Democratic incumbent that Reagan unseated, he also fairly portrays the new conservatism and ""Creative Society"" philosophy of Ronald Reagan and his supporters. I highly recommend this work as essential for understanding the beginnings of the Reagan Revolution. After this, a good read that bookends the subject is John Ehrman's 'The Eighties: America in the Age of Reagan.'",,1

Frankly, at least for now it would be 2 or 3 on my list. No, it's not perfect, but it was outstanding, and kept me going throughout. I finished the entire series in a week, and now can't wait to start the next set - though I may have to put it off for a brief bit while I attend to other things.As always, the dialogue is masterful, the pacing was good. I definately recomend this to any and everyone.",,1

We get a better understanding of the mind of God, the value of life and the salvation that every soul needs through Jesus Christ. I highly recommend it.",,1

Some advice seems questionable - for example preshading with a Sharpie; in my experience it'll seep from underneath any kind of paint.Overall the book was disappointing for me.

TONE_POLARITY,"As an avid reader of gay fiction I was anxious to delve into my first Dennis Cooper piece. The title attracted my attention as well as the cover art. The cover even stated that The Village Voice had selected this title as one of the top 25 books of 2004. (Shame on the Voice)! So the story began. I liked the way the author relayed the events through chat room discussions. However, as the book progressed some of the violent sex acts reported were a complete turn-off for me. If you like reading about interesting sexual encounters this book certainly has its fill, but when we start getting into castration and the killing of male escorts this is where I have to draw the line for myself. If this sort of thing gets you going I highly recommend this piece, otherwise, forget it! Needless to say I don't think I will be reading any other of Dennis Cooper's titles.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The CD features primarily smooth jazz or schmaltzy arrangements. Not too much actually grips the listener or is passionate. To overcompensate for this, Dianne tends to oversing shrilly on a few numbers, hitting high notes for the sake of hitting high notes, rather than for the sake of the song. There are much better albums of hers out there. As another reviewer notes, there are a couple of good cuts. My favorite is where she swings the blues with Joe Williams in a big band setting on ""Deed I Do"", which is a lot of fun. But when I want to listen to Dianne, I'll be reaching for one of the jazzier or more soulful albums she has recorded.",,0

Because it truly puts you in a category and provides you suitable careers according to your personality type, i.e., what careers you'd possibly find enjoyable based on the functioning of your brain.But each type offers varied fields of career. For example, as in my INFP type, you could be an actor as well as a psychological counselor. That means you have to pounder into what your abilities and interests are before you can find the right career.Thus I worked with ""Discover What You Are Best At"" by Linda Gale, which shows your aptitudes(abilities) to narrow the focus.

TONE_POLARITY,"I've read and enjoyed this author's previous series set in Alaska, so I was really looking forward to a new sleuth and a new setting. However, this novel reads more like a travelogue with a bit of mystery thrown in as an afterthought.

Some very esoteric facts can be found here as well, such as why Balanchine likes the fingers and hands held the way he does and why many don't like it that way.

TONE_POLARITY,I spoke Azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. Out of the limited amount of literature on the subject I chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around.

Do not expect a textbook on the language :),,1

TONE_POLARITY,This movie was the instight to relationships everyone needs to have. This book was as true as it gets. Brittney Murphy and Ron Livingston were wonderful.

She ends up in love with a wonderful guy and he ends up leaving on a business trip. With the coxing of her peers she decides to check into his past relationships and starts to nose around in his palm pilot for insight to his past relationships. Its funny how she comes to a relaziation about her relationships and relationships of others. This movie could not be more true to fact. Loved every minute of it.

I've given the book to two other people, and they both loved it, but for completely different reasons.

It is also about romance and the call of the heart.I am a family history buff and after reading the book the first time through, went back and pulled out the genealogy details, which amplified and enlarged the story itself.Who cares? you say, well, if you are interested in the book's characters enough to go back through the book to better understand them then you know the book has been worth your time.A gentle read and heart warming, and good character studies.

This CD targets those who embrace apathy as if it were virtue. The CD as a whole is unmoving and emotionless.

I have used other ""Dummies"" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that ""it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse"" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I just thought this book started out with promise, but really started to lag during the middle all the way towards the end. It was just so slow and I kept yelling at myself that something needed to happen! I didn't feel the main character solved anything especially when it seemed like Jackson was supposed to be some big thing to her. Then at the end I got totally bored and I was expecting to turn the page and at least have 10 or so more pages, not a couple sentences. It really caught me off guard how abruptly it ended. This is my first read from this particular author so maybe it was just this one book, but to me wasn't worth the try.",,0

I bought it as a gift for a son in law who lives out of town so when I flew in for a visit I could help him tackle a big shelving installation using 3 inch decking screws.

It reversed direction smoothly when needed and was easy to handle.I was almost sad to leave it behind at his house but it was his birthday present after all!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Wow!This is a GREAT book for the graphic/web designer wanting to learn actionscript. I own or have read many others that don't cover the basics or the thought processes behind writing in a scripting language. Most books on this topic started out over my head with little explaination and were accompanied by buggy and/or old code. With clear and consice writing, Philip uses the first half of the book to fully explain programming concepts as they pertain to scripting in Flash, and then follows up with examples of how to implement these ideas.I can't say enough about how far this book has taken me into the scripting world. Kudos to Kerman.",,1

The detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish. The build up to the conclusion was predictable ( in my opinion) which made it even more difficult to finish.

If you're a beginning bassoonist and you're looking for a good reed, look elsewhere -- a bassoonist will only play as well as their reed allows them to, and Jones reeds will only hold you back.If you have no other alternatives locally, then I'd suggest finding a quality, reputable reedmaker online, because these reeds are simply poorly constructed.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"""Silky"" is actually a garage-rock effort, pretty far removed from Andre's R&B roots. But it's also the greatest garage-rock album of the '90s, and would have fit right alongside the Gories on the Crypt Records roster of the decade. For a 60+-year-old man, Andre's mind is strictly in the juvenile gutter, but at least he's a talented exhibitionist. References to sex (all types) abound, albeit with comparitively little obscenity. Two cuts especially, the obvious ""Let Me Put It In"" and the jealously apocalyptic ""Everybody Knew,"" make him sound like he's in physical pain. He growls, huffs, and doesn't give a damn what you think. What more could you ask?",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"All of the Le Carre novels involve the theme of betrayal and exploitation in some subtle manner. This is one where the main character, as actress, has to betray and exploit herself. She - and by implication, we as readers - never know what is authentic and what is artifice in her. Le Carre demolishes the distinction. For this very quality she is taken on by the Israeli secret service, who need to construct an elaborate but plausible facade. Like all Le Carre's other novels there's an ambivalence about what is right and wrong. The characters are complex, ofttimes confusing in their motives and unsure of the efficacy and rightness of what they're doing. What makes this book unusually troubling is Le Carre's exposure of the fakeness and schism in the soul of western man.Is there anything bona fide and clear about us? Is life for us just theatre?",,1

I can only credit the foundation that this book taught for that success!I'm working with her younger sister now, and she loves it just as much. I even bribed her to eat all her dinner one night by offering to let her have another lesson after we finished. :D Our little boy (age 2 1/2) will sit at the table and try to mimic what my current 4-year old is doing.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is called ""A language and library reference"".As a reference book, I think this book falls far short. The material is randomly thrown together throughout the book.

I've little problem with this section. If you only need a C++ library reference this is a good book.The language material is quite poor in my opinion. While the book is not geared towards the beginner, finding a simple explanation of say virtual destructors is impossible.

I will never use any other opener as long as these are on the market as the quality is also excellent.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. Never the less, I still bought it, and was glad I did.",,1

We are just 2 adults in our home and the house is fairly clean. Yet this tool doesn't have enough power to scrub and clean tiles or greasy spots that arise from everyday use.I ended up buying a canister steamer (1500 Watts) for around 100 dollars, and that works for us.

I have both of Fiona Apple's prior albums and found that this one cannot compare. Maybe she should have stuck with Jon Brion? Maybe there was a reason her record label didn't want to release it?I bought this album based on the title track which I loved when I heard it on the radio, as I felt that this track showed some growth, musically and personally. But the rest of the album seems to lack in melody, direction and substance. Even her lyrics don't seem as profound as before, but that could possibly be because I grew up too.I would NOT recommend this album.",,0

However, after recieving them I couldnt help but open them up and tinker with them. I love magnetic toys.I was really disappointed in how hard they are to pose into different positions. The joints are really stiff and need a good bit of force and wiggling. Also, 2 of the magnets (one in a foot of one and one in a hand of another) have been inserted backwards because they repell instead of attract. Even so the hands will still stick together just at the sides instead.Other than that, these toys are pretty cool. I added some pics of my play time with them on my filing cabinet as they were doing some acrobotic rock climbing, haha!UPDATE: The magnets have almost all fallen out of the feet and hands of these guys after one 10 minute play by my child.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a landmark album in the history of hip hop. Though it did not have the mainstream appeal of todays corporate rap machine, it enjoyed huge popularity. And was very important in terms of guiding hip hop into its concious activist, and spiritual movement. However, the album is by no means preachy. Brother J is one of the most gifted lyricist of all time. He paints beautiful images with his metaphors and analogies which allow the listener to be immersed in a world of intellect and spirituality outside the eurocentric philosophies.Beyond that- the beats are just banging. X clan ignited the use of old school(70's/80's)samples. But they go a step further and incorporate tribal rhythms which connect the modern urbanite to a time past when the wisdom of the ages was not lost. This album is a must for anyone that wants to hear truly inspired and purposeful hip hop.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"A terrible movie and a complete waste of time, unless you are a big fan of computer games such as Call of Duty World at War and Black Ops. It is an almost uninterrupted orgy of noise and screams. After ten minutes I was totally exhausted. The characters are completely one-dimensional. Macho men running and shooting at everything that moves. They communicate by cliche oneliners. The storyline is as flat as the heartbeat of a recently deceased person. After fifteen minutes or so, I was so bored, numbed and fed up by it all that I ""switched off"", crept behind my newspaper and left it to my son and his friends to complete the viewing. From behind the newspaper I patiently endured the endless string of gunshots, explosions and shouted commands. Do not be fooled: there's hardly any science in this fiction, it's just a ""one-in-a-dozen"" war movie. I cherished the silence as almost never before when at last the TV set was switched off.

Well, that's what this book is. Near the end of the book, you will find out that the author and her husband were interviewed for The God Makers documentary, which, if you don't know, is an extremist, inflamatory, biased, unbalanced look at the Mormon church.

Vivica Fox was as lovely as always. In order to see this kind of movie one must come with an open mind and understand it's something not to be taken too seriously. I have to say I'm happy to see Miguel Nunez getting more work and recognition than usual. He's truly a very talented actor and hopefully we'll see more of him.

Wait until you read more reviews from sane people about what they think of it. I would have given it one star, but it was well researched, so I'm giving it two stars. But skip it anyway. Believe me, I was born in Wisconsin, there ain't nothing going on up there worth making a DVD about. Except for Ed Gein, but even that was 40 years ago.

TONE_POLARITY,"Finally got around watching this kung-fu flick -- supposedly Jet's last martial arts film. It's never fair to compare Jet Li's hard-boiled ballet-like Shaolin kicks with Bruce Lee's no-BS brute-force chops, and both movies are extremely entertaining each in its own ways. ""Fearless"" features great Jet Li kung-fu action, yet it also has a ""soul,"" so to speak: the plot reveals the frustrations and dejections of a people beaten down by foreign ""devils,"" and a populace yearning to regain its lost respect and past glory. It's surprising to this viewer that the portrayal of the Japanese fighter is very sympathetic, unlike Bruce Lee's or other Chinese-vs.-Japanese fist-fight films. The special effects are rather superfluous but overall does not hurt the film's imagery or flow. A really entertaining and enjoyable movie, indeed.",,1

This one is a pick your level and all based around a menu screen. You have to play a lot of the levels multiple times, and the reward system is pretty awful.

This song is absolutely sensual and the sexy voice of the singer lends it more than just a shade of wickedness.

TONE_POLARITY,"I thought this movie was supposed to be scary? I listened to the reviews and saw the commercials, and then I sat there waiting to jump out of my seat. Well, I guess I did want to jump out of my seat... and go see another movie! It starts off slow and unfortunately that is the way it ends. It is filmed like a documentary, but I have seen scarier things watching the Discovery Channel. And compared to Jaws...pulleeezz, this movie does not compare. The only thing that was really scary was the acting. The reviewers who gave this movie high ratings may have been distracted by the full frontal nudity in the first 10 minutes, and like the woman in this film I also wished for death by the end.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Ever since I saw this movie I have loved it! My friend and I rented it one night and have loved it ever since. I love the plot. Basically, a cat named Mewsette(Judy Garland) leaves her devoted friend, Jeane Tom, and her home on the farm. She wants to go to Paris. When she gets there, she is tricked by the bad guy, Meowrice. Jeane Tom and his buddy Robespierre spend most of the movie looking for Mewsette. I won't tell you any more because that would spoil it. This movie is absolutely hilarious! I find myself rolling every time I watch it! The only thing I don't like about it is when Meowrice sings. Aaah! It is really wierd. I wish they would change the title, though.

But this is not Braveheart, and it isn't trying to be.Roland Emmerich really shows that he is a great director who can handle a great script without destroying it with specialeffects. After Independence Day and Godzilla, Roland has finally stopped relying on the effects (allthough there are effects, but they do not own the screen at any time) and started to trust his own skills.He also has great help from the cast. Mel Gibson is great as both the carrying father, and as the cruel buther he is in war. Heath Ledger is abolutley a name to recon with for the future, and makes the son very well.So all and all this is a graet movie, that does NOT make all englishmen out to be a sead of evil, that some people have claimed.",,1

Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/lover, a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. Dustin Hoffman is pure genius in this movie.

Just wanted something I could plug my nano in and so replace the boombox I had here. So for what is required of it, I have no problems with the sound, as I never really crank it up. However, the 'visual' component was a major disappointment. Within a week the 'bulb' at the top no longer functioned. I gather there is a short of some type, as if I push down on the glass ball on top I'll get a visual light effect for 2 seconds. Otherwise, nothing. Since part of the appeal of this was to have the light effects WITH the speakers, I'd have to advise caution in buying this.

I found very little depth in the first one hundred and twenty pages and finally gave up on the book.

I make fruit tortes in the pan, and although the batter is very thick, it invariably leaks a lot. I have to put a baking pan under the springform or have a very messy oven. Plus I lose a lot of batter out the bottom. I have tried lining the pan with foil, which prevents the leaks, but makes for a somewhat mushy cake bottom. Even with nothing in the pan, you can see it does not have a great seal. ALSO, it is a pain to clean, as the batter cooks into the ridge around the base(where the sides sit), and you have to scrape it out with a fine-bladed knife or spatula. Cake doesn't slip readily from the base, so you have to serve the cake on the base, which is not only unattractive, but is non-stick, so you have to be really careful if you are using a metal cake cutter.

I've been using this one for almost a year now, on a daily basis, in huge yard wars. It mean that this thing has literally shot tens of thousands of times, and it's just as reliable as it was when I first purchased it. Take it from an expert; this is a very good budget gun. It's reliable, powerful, pretty accurate, and will never jam, for as long as you take good care of it.Also, I want to note that when people complain about jamming or accuracy, it's generally due to low quality of the plastic ammo.

Even after placing the reciever less than 10 feet from the microphones, the problems persisted. To make matters worse, AA Duracell batteries do not fit. They are slightly longer than generic AA batteries, but the added length is too much for the unusally small tollerences in the battery compartment. Even generic batteries have to be forced in place.

Barnes however can elicit no empathy from his readers and, if there are any redeeming features in the denouement, I'm afraid I didn't have the heart or stamina to find out.

When watching movies - the soundtrack sizzles and the dialogue is crystal clear. While watching the Superbowl - I heard this funny popping noise coming from the opposite side of the room from me -and then realized I was hearing someone at the game, sitting by a microphone and applauding. Clear as a bell.I don't think I would like these as well for a dedicated bookshelf stereo speaker - they reproduce mid to high range well, but don't have much bass response.

For those who are mildly interested and are just stepping into the world of new ideas and thinking in terms of 'the meaning of life' then this book will probably put you off.

TONE_POLARITY,"I found the author's account of her drug addiction to be rather pathetic, to be honest. I too went through a time in my life, lasting much longer than her, where I couldn't get enough ecstasy. We called them ""dumpers"" for some reason. Yes, the high times were great, and when it wore off you felt empty and miserable. Blah, blah, blah. So what? It's not like it was the worst time I've ever had in my life. If anything, I had a good time having fun and then I grew up and decided what was truly important in life. Sobriety fits more with what I want to do with the rest of my life. So I quit ecstasy and cocaine. Big deal. It's not like ecstasy is even physically addictive, unlike cigarettes and blow. In fact, I found smoking to be much harder to quit. In summary, I personally found this book to be whiny and shallow.",,0

This is probably the best known of all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and it it really deserves it's classic status. It is a gripping tale mixing crime investigation with a touch of the supernatural and is after 100 years still a page-turner. Arthur Conan Doyle helped start a genre that continues to entertain as evidenced by the countless crime novels and detective shows on TV. Despite the potential overexposure Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson still seem relevant and the deductive reasoning Holmes employs to solve the mystery of the Hound Of The Baskervilles is so entertaining that I read this in one day, unable to put it aside.

Performance: quality seems decent paired w/ an iPhone 3G (3.0 firmware), but the range is ghastly even by BT standards - signal cuts out completely ~15 ft from the phone (I have another A2DP headset that almost doubles that and degrades quality more gracefully on the way out instead of cutting out completely).

You've seen the same basic premise handled much better a dozen times before (even in hogwash like The Sentinel) and Hooper does nothing new with it. He also never generates any real suspense in Toolbox, the gore murders are silly and pointless, and the acting is wildly uneven. It's too bad because there are a couple ideas here that you can imagine (or have already seen) put to effective use, but Hooper just doesn't make it work.",,0

The inherent humor in the scenario of one man observing another is explored, not exploited, in an intelligent and witty fashion. I particularly enjoyed the fact that whole scenes would pass with no dialogue at all. Also noteworthy was the cinematography, which gave everything a handsome Nordic sheen.My second source of enjoyment were the reviews posted herein; it's rare to see so many good reviews so unanimous in their praise of a work, whether book, CD, or movie.

Only redeemed by the thoughtful insite of a few commentators. If you have not read the books it will entice you to read them (if the theatrical movies haven't). Peter Jackson is not on this DVD as an other reviewer implied. It does have bits of JRR himself. The Biography was good but also is on other DVDs. The Brothers Hildebrandt discuss their paintings but it would have been better if lead by an interviewer..they do babble on a bit.

Therefore, I believe the plastic melted, and that it did so in the beginning. There isn't a replacement part. This I found out after waiting on hold for ten minutes. The product is shoddy and unsubstantial. To call it ""commercial"" is a misnomer. I suppose it is no longer in production. I suggest anyone in the market look closely at the PS 250 as it looks quite similar. Check reviews before purchasing.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. If I were a writer I might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. A good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. If you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. It is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever Ms. Foxx has up her sleeve next.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This mat is definately worth the extra money. I practiced yoga five days a week for 4 months, blowing out one cheaper mat and causing significant signs of wear on the second one. Once this mat is broken in, I found it to not only be quite sticky, but also to provide excellent cushioning for me knees. It is also larger than most other mats, so there is less need to read just your position on the mat as frequently to avoid contact with others in a crowded yoga class.This mat is also excellent for those wanting to practice yoga at home on carpet. My other mats always slid around on my carpetted floor, but this one is heavy enough to stay put. If you are committed to a yoga practice, invest in this mat and you won't regret it. The only negative is that it is so heavy I would not necessarily recommend it to yogis that walk or bike to class.Namaste!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Toshiba SD3950 has all the add-ons a basic DVD player owner could want. A very nice remote control, Auto-play for both DVD's and audio cd's (also autoplays Mp3's), very easy set-up...just plug in and let'er rip. That is where the niceties end.The Toshiba SD3950 has terrible audio, primarily on Mp3 and CD playback. The sound is distorted, it's as though the outputs are overdriven. Audio on DVD's is not all that great either. You can set up the audio to hear dialogue using the audio settings, but you sacrifice overall audio quality, this because the player raises mid-range and nearly ignores other frequencies. Thus overall audio quality is sacrificed so you can hear dialogue you may not be able to hear otherwise.Bottom line: NICE features, NICE Remote, VERY,VERY POOR audio!!!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who rave about this film. The story of one night of cruising in a 1962 California city hasn't aged a bit in the 33 years since it was first released. I ""saw"" this movie several times as a kid, but it's meaningless until after you've been out of high school for a number of years. The cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock & roll. Ron Howard is a fine director, but moviegoers have really missed out since he quit acting. Young MacKenzie Phillips is fabulous. The scene where Charles Martin Smith attempts to buy Whiskey is classic. Very enjoyable.",,1

I'm not suggesting there isn't room for another mixed race exploration. But with standards like the Color of Water, Walker's poor-me tone just doesn't wash.Given the editing problems in this book, one can only guess at the original manuscript. After so carefully describing the male genetalia of her many male lovers, how is it possible that the reader is supposed to be content ""knowing"" that the author is a lesbian.By the time I finished this book, I felt cheated that I'd spent the time on this poor excuse instead of something more enjoyable.",,0

It does not lock into place like it supposed to do. If you bump the can the top falls of. The sound it makes is so faint it does not bother my cats. The air sprayed out within 4 days and it was mostly when a person was near it and not the cats. I called the manufacturer thinking it was a defective top and they sent me another which does the same thing.Total waste of my good hard earned money.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,After skimming through the book I found that it was hardly sophisticated as it was originally described.

TONE_POLARITY,"I was surprised at how funny these comedians were. I was also very pleased with the variety of acts there were. The first comedian was funny in his own right (used a lot of one liners) but also used a lot of facial expressions and hand gestures in addition to his humor. The next comedian was VERY dry but at the same time funny. He was a little slow at first, but once he got going it was funny. The next guy was more of a prop comedian and did a great job with it.I definitely recommend this DVD. I greatly enjoyed watching. With that said, these are not shows you would consider headliner comedians. However, they are quite enjoyable.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I loved this book, it fully held my attention and I wanted the outcome to be good for the characters. However, I must say that I did think that at some points the characters were more like caricatures. Granted this may be intentional on the part of the author, but I didn't care for that aspect of the book. The heroine, Dolores is not really a standard heroine as at some points you feel that she really is her own worst enemy, but it is because of this that the author successfully conveys her humanity to the reader. She is a poor broken soul looking for a peaceful life, whatever she considers to be enough just to keep her balanced. Finally, all I want to say is, read this book, it is a swift read because you DO want to find out what the eventual outcome will be!!!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I like the Steven Raichlen Rib rack very well. It will allow me to smoke 4 racks of pork spare ribs on my big green egg without any problem.

TONE_POLARITY,"Without question, a truly awful movie. Not sure what Daryl Hannah was doing is this picture. Maybe it was part of her community service agreement with the court.

Oh Girl - Chi-Lites9. How Do You Do? - Mouth & MacNeal10. Rock Steady - Aretha FranklinThis collection of hit songs is especially interesting. Humor songs are well represented in Hot Rod Lincoln and I Gotcha. Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever. Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair. Brand New Key and How Do You Do could be described as cutesy, whereas Nice To Be With You is good mainstream pop. Many of these songs are otherwise hard to find. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This movie held my attention from beginning to end -- it is so beautifully photographed, quite dreamlike, and the two main actors (Huppert and Greggory) give some of their finest work to date. The pair seem like the most perfect married couple, who live in a beautiful home, decorated with amazing art, and who love to entertain lavishly on a regular basis. That dream comes crashing down to reality when Greggory finds a letter from his wife, stating she has left him for another man. All that being said, the film is far too short. One would think that there is much more of a story to tell, and so the ending is not very satisfying. I think of this more as a snapshot into the world of a very troubled relationship. Despite my criticism, it is a gripping film and definitely worth seeing.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I rated this movie 4 out of 5 stars based mostly on the heart-touching quality of it. It doesn't much matter if the ending is confusing and questionable. The ending just denotes that we all have spirits who need to fly, not be immobilized by an uncurable disease. If you watch the movie closely, there are some very artistic qualities about it, such as when Elijah Wood is bouncing the ball against the wall and there is a star of light shining between him and the wall.

TONE_POLARITY,"Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the unit hoping I wouldn't have the same problems. Well I didn't have the same problem (at least I didn't find one similar to my own). I prepped the unit as the directions described however my machine made a horrible noise. I don't know what it was doing but it was making a buzzing noise that was really loud but continued to pour water into my mug. After the cycle finished I tried the unit with a coffee pod. Nothing. Nothing happens. I've unplugged the unit and replugged it in. I have removed and reinserted the water container. I have unlocked and relocked the pod unit. When I press any of the buttons, nothing happens. It's like it's dead. I called their customer service number and he basically told me to do everything I've already tried.

After 1 week they finally replied. They stated that they believed the transformer was inop and asked if I could replace it myself. They said they would ship the part to me. I replied back saying that I could replace the part, gave them my address, and attached my receipt for purchasing the product. That was on October 5th, 20 days ago.

The authors have a unique writing style that is unlike others. It is not the usual dry textbook material that puts me to sleep. Instead, they keep the reader engaged using real world examples and openly discuss the pros and cons of particular approaches. This book is good for those who want one book that explains all of the concepts you need.",,1

He's too young and frankly, if Abberline was this weird he wouldn't have lasted on the force. Heather Graham is completely out of her depth.

In fact, more violence would've ruined the intensity of the film as a whole. And thank god for the few moments of comic relief&#65533;some of the only chances a viewer gets to release some of the pent up tension carried throughout the film.

Also, it is really written from the perspective of the more traditional Buddhist teachings, i.e. Hinayana or Theraveda, as opposed to the mystical Tibetan teachings that form the basis for Tantra or Mahayana forms.

The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead.

I've read most of the classics and loved them all but this was just a horribly pointless book. Holden is basically a rich emo kid stuck in 1945. All he did was roam around New York city, talking to stupid people, tried and horribly failed at picking up chicks, got drunk, smoked and then crashed at a closeted homosexual's apartment, because he was too afraid to tell Mommy and Daddy he had been expelled for the 3rd or 4th time. I seriously wanted to rip this book up and throw it in the trash, if it hadn't been a school assigned book. What was with his constant crying?

In retrospect, I should have bought Javascript Sourcebook instead--I learned HTML with that superb ""Sourcebook"" series, and i should have stuck with it. The Javascript Bible starts off promising for the beginner, and introduces JS well. But it then jumps into hundreds of objects and functions and doesnt explain their context and placement. I was lost. Another reviewer here said you'll get lost after Chap4--boy, is he ever right! After Chap4, the inexperienced JS programmer will be absolutely befuddled and clueless. To its credit, the book offers lots of code examples; but it doesn't explain how and why the code was written. I'm very disappointed.

Whenever you guys see Lucy special boxed sets that seem to good to be true as far as the prices are concerned, DO NOT buy them. I have had problems in the past with these videos. We are better off ordering from Columbia House if they have these available. At least the sound will be superior. We all love Lucy, but we all love our money too.

As with other T.F.H. publications under this series, the latter 90% of the book is ""standard"" content. You can buy a book about a Rottweiler and find the same 90% ""standard"" section (expect a lot of write-up about NYLABONE and its allied products)in it, with only the 1st 10% section devoted to the breed.

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is definitely not for beginners even if it mentions otherwise. I had never tried Pilates until I bought this book, it looked like it would be something that beginners could do -- NOPE. The exercises are not explained in detail enough to perform correctly, some are not explained enough so that you know what to do, I ended up making guesses, which is not something you should do with Pilates. This book is well written and made me more interested in Pilates, enough so to go and buy another book on it. I bought the Pilates book by Brooke Siler which had a wonderful modified beginner Pilate moves. It was easier to understand and perform. This book is probably alright for people who have been previously exposed to Pilates and have a general idea of what it is about and the moves that are performed.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Perhaps one of the best collections of poetry ever assembled, Sylvia Plath's poems are a must read for Plath fans and poetry buffs alike. Listed in chronological order (as much as possible), readers should pay particular attention to the poems from the summer of 1962 until the last poems in 1963 to fully appreciate the groundbreaking, enigmatic verse that defines Sylvia Plath. In addition to fifty poems written during her years as an undergrad at Smith College, there is a very interesting selection of notes including the original order of poems in Plath's Ariel collection (the order of the posthumous collection was altered following her death). A wonderful gift for (literate) college students (and not just English majors).",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I want a case as small as possible for mobility, and this is the smallest case I can find. I don't need space for batteries and memory cards.

Secondly with memory card so cheap nowdays I don't need to carry extra cards with me unless I want to shoot tons of video. I got a 2GB high speed card for around $40. A 4GB can be ordered for around $90. In fact I wish it could be smaller by eliminating the space for accessories so it wouldn't look fat while it is on a belt. I got a Tamrac 5693 Digital 3 earlier.

TONE_POLARITY,"Firstly, I loved Sam Raimi when he made Hercules and Xena. They were campy, and so fun to watch. The problem was, you never took them seriously. Now, imagine one of the best fantasy series every written, and then make it Hercules. It is painfully obvious that Sam Raimi never read more than perhaps the back cover of the book. It seems that they took his name from Spider-Man, and used that prestige and high budget to make the show.The cast (aside from Zed) seems like they were picked from the phone book. Richard, rather than a tall, built D'Haran man, he is a small, skinny guy. Ever woman in the midlands has hair just as long as Kahlan's, and Darken Rahl isn't even blonde!

Despite the thickness of this book it is quite a quick read. The subject matter is heavy, but it is appropriate. The writing style adds so much to the story and pauses in all of the right spots. By now, I'm sure you are all aware of the story matter and I will just add in that it is powerful and raw.

David L. Ransel's fascinating book reflects this dual nature of Russia and gives an insight into its complex inner soul. A wealth of details and astute observations make this book a pleasure to read.Most recent books about Russia concentrate on its urban aspects or on its general political or economic aspects. Unlike them, Village Mothers presents a picture of its rural life. Russia has been a largely rural, agricultural country for many centuries. Its industrialization started only a few decade ago. That's why it is important to understand the village life in Russia. David Ransel's book helps to do just that.",,1

This is the first of the books that she wrote even though it's not my favorite.Each chapter is about a new man that entered Chelsea's like (and more often than not, exited just as quickly). With wit and humor Chelsea revisits several one night stands that stood out in her life. Accompanied by her saucy group of gal pals, Handler takes on every city with the same attitude: find a glass of vodka and a hot man, STAT!It's completely irreverent and full of language that will disgust the average prude, this is a memoir for anyone who enjoys Chelsea's naughty sense of humor.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"for a long time, there wasn't a lot of asia video out there. then came some bootlegs, then the music videos and concerts in russia and europe. finally....a concert that spans the entire musical careers of all the members!!! it is so nice to see and hear songs from yes, king crimson, elp, and even...the buggles. for me, the highlight was asia doing a monster version of ""fanfare for the common man"". the band truly seemed to enjoy the variety of material, as well as all the classic asia songs. would have liked to see ""go"" played, but that is covered in other collections. i like steve howe, but pat thrall actually did a nice job in his asia stint. palmer is palmer....the king! downes is a creative force, and wetton has been one of my favorite vocalists since the 70's. asia fans....this is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I was disappointed in this DVD. It was not very funny. It was mostly just cynical and sometimes angry. The use of four letter words was over the top and unnecessary. I'm sorry to see a person who I thought was a genius at word play and political satire taking such a low brow approach. I'll stick with his earlier offerings.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I saw this movie when it first came out, just recently watched it again, and still felt the same way at the end, I cried because I was so happy. This is a great gift for mom's everywhere. Anyone who knows what moms really go through for their kids, the endless hours they work to put food on the table, to make sure their kids have clothing, and how they suffer when there is something wrong with their child or have to be away from them, will want to see this movie.Others may see the issues with immigrants into the US from Mexico but as I have learned in a recent history class in college, Americans used to cross over into Mexico illegally when they discovered how beautiful Mexicans and Mexico are. They married Mexicans to stay in Mexico before the US army illegally crossed into Mexico and started an illegal war with Mexico, The Mexican - American war. Most of the western half of the US used to be Mexican territory.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I was very disappointed in this movie. The previous performances of the actors tricked me into thinking this might be a good film. It is difficult to see Jack Black in a romantic lead even though I love the work he has done in films like High Fidelity and School of Rock. I kept pushing myself to watch a little longer hoping it would improve. I finally turned it off because I was bored to tears. I think a better job could have been done with the premise of trading homes and looking for romance.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This book gives a thorough treatment of OO concepts and how they can be implemented in Java. It's a good intro to the language as well, and is example-based in its coverage of concepts. After becoming frustrated with various reference books, I decided to look carefully for a book that would teach solid principles of OOP and also provide immediate experience in writing useful programs in Java. This book distinguishes itself by going above and beyond those requirements. The introduction to the emerging area of design patterns was inspirational. However, the book omitted treatment of Threads and Networking in favor of ""miscellaneous"" topics like RMI and JDBC, and particular applications that illustrate the principles of design patterns like Fast Fourier Transform and printing. Not a complete reference, but as an introduction to some very important software design concepts it cannot be beat by other books that try to cover the entire language.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"""Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolly Madison"" by Richard (...) Cote is excellent reading and a work of art. Mr. Cote has once again shown that he is one of the best writers of our era.

TONE_POLARITY,"In my opinion Green reached his peak somewhere around 1964-65. This CD is one of his very best. The collaboration bedwteen Green, Young and Jones is super. On the opnener ""Talkin about JC"" (John Coltrane of course)Young sets the groove, and then Green starts to groove, for every 12 bar chorus he digs deeper into the groove. I am also very fond of ""Luny Tune"". It gives a kick when Green takes off right after the lead, his guitar is singing, and his playing is flawless and totally relaxed. I always felt that Jones and Green goes very well together, and that is something that Jones confirms in the biography about Green, which is by the way highly recommended to all ""Green fans"".(REDISCOVERING THE FORGOTTEN GENIUS OF JAZZ GUITAR, by Sharony Andrews Green, MIller Freeman Books)",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The two comments about this being a cut version are misleading. This is the complete theatrical version as released at 238 minutes. There WERE various cut versions that the producers released without the director's approval, but this is not one of them. It's the version Visconti sanctioned to be released at the time. To speak of the only version worthy of release as being a 6 hour version is certainly a bit extreme. Would you refer to the approved theatrical release of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander as cut?",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Read this book when it was first released and have not been able to keep it out of my mind ever since, so I just finished reading it again. As a student of history, my greatest interest is in how the people lived and felt who shaped the events we call history. James F.

Especially impressive is his understanding of the mindsets of Yankees and Southerners and how this evolved as the State matured and grew.

I thought this tub would have a similar seat position as the Infant Bath Seat by Primo (in which my baby feels great) but it doesn't!!! His neck is all broken with his chin going into his chest. He naturally pushes on the back of his head to not break his neck. That doesn't feel relaxing at all even though he loves being in the water. You can see it on some of the pictures that some people posted. I don't see how it would get more comfortable as he gets older, the shape of the top of the lounge chair is just too rounded/curved...

There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make? In conclusion, this book is good for the basics of metal clay and to make the designs in the book only. You can incorporta your own ideas after learning the way to execute a design.

I had a much larger pump, that this Sunterra pump replaced, which moved more water than this little one and it failed after 2.5 years (warranty 1 year). It was three times the price.

He starts out with a version of ""If I Ruled the World."" Not the funk that may be expected from the Godfather but none the less, a good version. As the show goes on, it gets funkier and "" I Got The Feeling"" is James Brown at his best.I haven't had a chance to view the documentary from this set but I have seen it before on VH1 and it is quite good.Overall, great stuff but don't expect 21st Century quality.",,1

Gardiner's splendid rendition of this work with the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestra on the Erato label, I must disagree with the other reviewer here and weigh in with a lesser rating for Christophers and his ensemble. The tempi are comparatively breakneck at times, and the soloists generally aren't anywhere near the former's qualitative level. Yes, The Sixteen does avoid the common pitfall of taking the final chorus too slowly, but the recording overall fails to match both Gardiner and Parrott's performances in my book.

These symphonies were recorded over different sessions in '72 and '73, but the transfers are warm, vital, and really generously show the depth of this great orchestra.

TONE_POLARITY,"After reading another book that was essentially a collection of coincidences and being inspired to start a coincidence journal of my own, I picked up Bell's book to try to figure out what it all means.This is in many ways a scholarly book. Bell defines different types of coincidences and weaves in elements of Jung's theories, quantum mechanics and eastern religious thought to provide a framework for how to interpret these events. He gives interesting examples of coincidences and, unlike other books on coincidence I've read, ""translates"" them--looking beyond the ""oh, isn't that interesting"" to get to the possible message and meaning.His theory that coincidences are similar to dreams and can be interpreted as such changed my whole perception of coincidences. That alone was worth the price of the book.Overall, a very interesting and illuminating book that may change the way you look at the world.",,1

There music feels goth, with hints of electronica(but not to be confused with Neo-goth, or Eletronic/goth), and fused with the odd flavor of 80s pop. Intresting to say the lest. There compareable to no one in style much like Mindless Self Indulgence. When bands like these come around its hard not to take notice cause such orginal sounds turns into such ear candy. Its a virgin sound to your ears and to that asepc its a true treat. There closest compareable sounds are that of a Zeromancer clashed with London After Midnight. More so the later then the former. The only issue is that some of the music although catchy, gets bland after numerous listens. I dont like to plug other bands, however if your taste brought you this far i suggest giving London After Midnight a try...a bit more darker with a harder male vocal lead.

I replaced the old one, a different brand, because it had became lumpy and misshapen after a long period of time.

TONE_POLARITY,"I gave this 4 stars because it came with a curious little paddle attached to the inner container that I never understood. Also, there was a number wheel on the outer lid that I never quite understood either.I bought this retail for about $20 a number of years ago. I can't believe sellers are trying to get $150-500 for this! What's my incentive to buy when there are new, much fancier yogurt makers for $60 or less?That being said, I always had good yogurt from it, no problems. I had failures too, but it was due to my errors, not the machine. I like the simple easy-to-clean single container, rather than the 5 or more containers other models offer.I came to Amazon looking for a replacement because mine was lost in a move. Too bad its been discontinued. If Salton brings it back my suggestion would be to have a glass container rather than plastic, and a battery option along with the plug-in.",,1

I got it ...last fall and hoped to use it for color printing mainly, but also to print small black and white documents (I have access to a laser printer for most black and white). I bought it because of the low priced ink tanks.What I have found out is that the S400 does not print when I want it to. At first, I was using the parallel port connection (don't even think about doing this). The connection isn't fast enough for the printer and every page you try to print will be illegible. Using the USB connection has helped, but I still throw out about 1 out of every 3 pages that I print because they don't come out correctly.In short, the S400 isn't reliable. I find myself walking across the building to print a single page instead of trying for 20 or 30 minutes on my S400. Don't buy this printer. It will be a waste of your time and money.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this book because of the ratings and because it was an author I had never read. Well, I won't be buying another one of Mr. White's books after reading this one.The story line included a bunch of sub stories that really didn't have anything to do with the main storyline. (Spoilers ahead!!) A son who had ordered his own paternity test. An ex lesbian lover pregnant with Doc's child who turns out not to be an ex lesbian. A neurotic best friend that has a promonition that Doc is dying while in the middle of surgery and puts himself in a drug crazed coma to reach out to him. And on and on and on. The book starts out with a bang and then loses it entirely and never picks up speed again. I would say 50% of the book's writing does not belong in the book and doesn't add to the storyline. I only finished it because I hate not finishing a book, but this was ridiculous.I won't bother recommending this book to anyone. Sorry.",,0

What I do mean is that if you have had past experience with this kind of transaction and had a good agent that walks you through the process than you have already covered much of the content of this book- like home inspections and appraisals and oh ya duh get a good lawyer.

Bought her a 99-cent tear-drop shaped keychain LED light on a whim and its perfect. Brighter and easier to use, replaceable battery, and 1/7 the cost. I really expected more from this company, but both this light and their customer perspective are obsolete. No complaint with the quality of construction. Solid aluminum and O-rings as usual. Just has the minor flaw of casting a weak and scattered beam, way below the performance of modern LED technology. The light is yellow and full of shadow artifacts that prevent a clean illumination.

With this in mind, of course, this book is more about Mr. Grogan's family experiences before, during and after the ownership of Marley. Unfortunately for the reader, but probably fortunately for Mr. Grogan, the author's family life is not particularly exciting, either. This book is unlikely to appeal to the non-dog-owner, and quick perusal of the positive reviews here support my claim. Although I do like dogs, Marley and his family do not seem very different from any other dog-owning family out there. Unless you have a Fido in the family, I recommend you pass on this one.",,0

This excellent book tells us that the reality is that our eyes and our visual attention are our most important crash-guards. The writer, Dr. Kenneth C. Mills, makes his point on why good vision is so important and then tells us how to develop our attention to make us safer drivers. You can read this book in one sitting and learn ways to become a safer driver -- it could save your life. It contains many of the things you always wanted to tell your new teen-aged driver, but didn't really know how to explain.

TONE_POLARITY,"I read ""Fatherland"" and liked it. Terrific premise--that Hitler had not lost WWII--and reasonably well-made characters.Then I read ""Enigma"" and hated it. I kept expecting it to get better. It never did. Unlike ""Fatherland,"" ""Enigma"" merely stuck to facts--the breaking of the German code in WWII. The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore.""Pompeii"" is more like ""Enigma""--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it.And it is equally dull. I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details. The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional. They are predictable and uninteresting. And the plot, of course, is known beforehand. The romance has no sparks.If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you. But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm not a rich man and my need for this information was not pressing, so I waited to purchase this book until the price dropped a little. I managed to get it used, but as far as I'm concerned [money] was still too much to pay given the potential of the subject. I agree with some of the user reviews I've read about editing. Kaplan suffers from Stephen-King-itis, i.e., made a name for himself as a guru and apparently believes he's above editing and each word is golden. I agree with another review about it being a good visual title on the shelf, it's just too bad it lacks specific detail and workable code samples so you can be sure he actually knows what he's talking about. (Yes, he does often know what he's talking about, but if you weren't familiar with his reputation, it wouldn't be proven by this book.)",,0

This book is perfect for you if you have been playing classical guitar regularly and for some time now -If you are trying to grow in your ability past the beginner stage and the early intermediate stage.This book is something you should get if you have some time to commit to the guitar on a regular basis because the warm-up exercises and the various left/right hand exercises take time. Just doing these exercises will take an hour of your playing time.If you already have a repertoire and you want to become more technically proficient then this book is perfect. the exercises really do work. If you have the time to commit to this book your playing will improve dramatically. It will help you identify and improve technical points that you are weak at.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Husker Du's second album of 1985 was this underrated gem, perhaps their strongest album from front to back. Produced now by Mould and Hart, the sound is brighter, with more attack, almost like power-pop hopped up on hardcore punk. The songs are great, too, with the FANTASTIC Makes No Sense At All, Keep Hanging On, Divide and Conquer, Flip Your Wig, and Private Plane as some of the strongest. Two of the best songs Husker Du EVER RECORDED, Grant Hart's beuatiful Green Eyes, and Bob Mould's damn-near-perfect Games, are the centerpieces of this album, in my opinion. Simply jaw-dropping, the both of them. The Baby Song is a throwaway, but it'll make you laugh. Fantastic record, and essential. Their last album for SST before moving to Warner Bros.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This by far has to be one of the most difficult books ive attempted to read, and i to no extent mean the words more so the topics touched in this story. the only thing pushing me to finish it is hope that some sort of justice is served in the plot. The fact that a 40 year old deprives a 12 year old girl of her innocence will at most times in the book leave you in disgust and feeling disturbed. But credit be given where its due, the author is a genius and some would say a madman himself to be able to tell this story of a mad man. I do admire that with the touchy subjects that he wrote on he never used any sort of vulgar vocabulary to describe certain scenes. in my opinion its a mentally strenuous book to jump into because of the monster who is telling his story but the author hit it dead on, minus some parts which i think get very repetitive. take what you can from this story, which is hard to with a closed mind, and then move on.",,1

Each of these episodes are cut at around 30-34 minutes, but when they air on nbc only 21 minutes can be shown. So these deleted scenes are just basic ""extra"" scenes... they're actually as funny as the regular show... so it's a great bonus.

This gait, while used by Standardbred horses, is very different than a trot. That's sort of like putting a football player on the cover of a baseball hitting manual!

In a promise to his dying sister, Jennifer, he says he will leave the big city to take care of heart attacks and sprains in the slower pace of the country. On his way out of Chicago, he receives a call from Meghan, a childhood friend, who is looking for a little comfort from the rainstorm and a ride to her parents' house.The story of Stephen and Meghan's early relationship is told brilliantly in flashbacks. When the story catches up to present day, the plot twists and turns like a scenic mountain road, blending Stephen and Meghan's lives with a series of jewel thefts. This is by far the most tantalizing O'Malley mystery. Stephen's struggle with the concept of having a relationship with God adds spiritual depth to the novel.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!",,1

The technical prouesse is nothing short of astonishing: one has to try and imagine the sheer physical difficulty of handling the double bass, the physical effort invoved in playing this most awkward of instruments, its bulk, the weight of its strings, the inertia of the bow. Then there's the beauty of the double bass: the volume, the overtones, the basses, the harmonics. And then there's Meyer... Casals' recordings are a must, and unsurpassed on the cello. What Meyer does here is add another dimension, literally: using the bass' limitations, he makes them work for him, for the music, for us and for our enjoyment. This is art of the highest order, beautifully recorded and produced. Even if you have Casals' recordings, get these. They'll change the way you hear the Suites",,1

It was brief and I felt like I was reading a children's book. I received more comfort and hope from the paragraph I received about the Rainbow Bridge from the SPCA. I was very disappointed that the book was so short with very little detail. Normally Sylvia describes the afterlife and the ornate buildings and duties and way of life in great detail, so my expectations were high. I read this book cover to cover in about 5 minutes and came away angry that I wasted my money.

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm a fairly recent BNL fan. In fact, I only really got to know their music after the recent ""Pinch Me"". But I'm very glad I did. The songs are alternately fun and sweet, but they're almost all excellent. Even my sister, who only likes old stuff, had to admit that this was a great CD. This CD has all the songs I know and love, such as Pinch Me, One Week, and If I Had $1,000,000, plus some truly great ones I've never heard before, such as Get In Line, and the Wizard of Magicland. I was slightly disappointed it didn't have ""Who Needs Sleep"", ""Some Fantastic"" or ""Never is Enough"" but you can't have everything.I happen to know that this band didn't get famous for being a bunch of pretty boys, like certain other bands I can mention. BNL got famous from pure talent?",,1

I surfed Solal's album selection on this site and settled on Bluesine as a place to start.Rarely have I been more disappointed. The music is choppy, discordant, and aimless. This just isn't the kind of jazz piano I like. Some do, I suppose, but like pickled jellyfish, its definitely an acquired taste. It is likely to gather dust until someone asks to hear it because a couple of listens is about all I could take.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Ok, this is pretty much the only dive knife you'll get on Amazon and not cry about losing it on the first day of use if you do of course. It's a nice dive knife, case is plastic and does have a push with one hand operation. The straps feel good around my lower leg. Who cares if it lasts. Nothing in salt water lasts anyways so to buy an expensive one would mean you got money to blow or your lacking something else. Lol It could save your life so the cost goes well with the construction of it. I'm using it for a basic Lobster dive snorkeling. Hey don't forget to get a dive light too for those under rocks see! Get one that has the 4 AA. Ok I'm out! Be safe!!! Reply and I'll tell you which mind blowing dive light I got that is awesome! Oh by the way I got the sharp point in green. If you drop it you can spot it quickly in dark waters. It has happened to me so many times I keep buying knives so like I said nothing lasts forever!",,1

But the handle seemed to be obviously cheap and shoddy to me, before I used it. And then it just fell apart when I did.I don't get where GustBuster is coming from on this. Most people buy super cheap umbrellas on the street while it's raining. But if someone takes the time to look for umbrellas on Amazon, they probably won't really care if an umbrella is $30 or $40. I just wanted something solid. I had a good umbrella that lasted me 12 years, and then I lost it. I wanted to replace it. That's the GustBuster market -- people who take the time to look around, who are willing to pay more, and who want quality.It seems crazy to cut corners on the handle to save a buck.

However, I am always on the look-out for new authors to add to my collection. Nina Corbett hit the nail on the head with this book. I really enjoyed the story because it felt like I was sharing and listening with two of my good friends. Ms. Corbett's unique way of telling a story allowed me to express some sort of emotion at each chapter--whether it was laughter, sadness or utter ""hands on my hips"" disbelief.I also enjoyed the way the title and the chapters related to well known songs. Ms. Corbett also impressed me with the list of questions at the back of the book. It made me want to start my own book club just so that I could share this book with others!!!""Standing In The Shadows Of Love"" is a real page turner and has a story that every woman can relate to.

And the CD with sample forms is interesting and may inspire some processes you might want to try.The only way this book could be a bit better is if it had more ""what to do when X happens"".

I can't tell you how aggravating it is to try and figure out the pronunciation of a kanji when you have to decode the authors pronunciation. And it's not just the ""ti""s being ""chi"", it's the ""tsu""s being ""tu""s, and the ""ji""s being ""zi""s, and the lines over the letters and all of this would have been fine if they just gave the kana next to the pronunciation garble. Not to mention the book is 34 years old. I don't want to say this is a bad book because it has a lot of good parts in it but I can't in good conscience give this book a good rating.

I bought this one as a gift for a friend who liked mine.Gets REALLY hot, hotter than any other hair tool I have used before. I have really thick hair, and it works great. My friend who I purchased it for has very thin, fine hair, and it works great for her too. She just uses a cooler setting.I wrap the cord around the flat iron for storage, and the cord got pretty wonky pretty fast.

TONE_POLARITY,"Story of British spies ~ MI5 in particular ~ from one who livedthrough it. Wright was the first scientist to join MI5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. The bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the Fifth Man ~ Wright's candidate is Roger Hollis, who was head of MI5 during the early Sixties ~ a well-hidden Soviet mole like Philby and his ilk. Reading it, at times, it appears that Wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything Le Carré wrote. As far as the Fifth Man goes, my mind is still open, but Wright gives excellent cause to suspect that Hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Dr. David Benner presents the case for his short-term, five-session model for pastoral counseling with succinctness, clarity, fairness, and sound argumentation. In addition, he goes to great lengths to explain how such a model could work effectively within a church setting. The last three chapters are especially practical in their step-by-step presentations of the strategic pastoral counseling model and two well-presented case studies. His discussion of the inherently spiritual nature of many life issues (pp.62-67) is a very helpful and profound elucidation of the pastoral counselor's role. I highly recommend this volume to all pastors of local churches and all practicing or aspiring Christian counselors.",,1

I found myself getting completely unnerved just wishing they would hurry up and bury her! The ending was a great surprise and earned the story a few extra stars in my opinion.

TONE_POLARITY,"This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"With each new release, Steven Curtis Chapman expands his ability to express passion through his music. More and more he moves beyond the soft, contemplative, predictable songs of his early career and ventures into stronger lyrics and more soulful music. He hasn't quite hit his peak yet, but the growth is really starting to show.Edgier songs include Lord of the Dance, The Walk and Rubber Meets the Road, songs that challenge with their lyrics and motivate with their music. Some softer but equally good tunes include the moving Free and inspiring Let Us Pray. Most of the rest seem to hover in the vanilla zone, not bad but not outstanding either.Again, if I had rated this back in 1996, I probably would have given it 5 stars. Knowing how far along Chapman has progressed, and the level of his ability that this album represents, I give it a strong four.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory",,1

There has always been, and will always be, class distinction based upon income, education, family history, physical features, etc. It happens in every race and culture, and I am not surprised that it happens in the African-American race. I believe that many of the organizations that Mr. Graham allude to in his book were initially formed as ""support systems"" for those few Blacks who became educated and successful. During the early years, these organizations were probably nothing more than social clubs. But over years, I believe that many of the organizations' members have re-identified their main purpose and developed a social conscience.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought two pairs of these about a year ago (one for home, one for work), and since then both of them have broken.The first one had a wire break internally so that half the time only one headphone worked. Later, the joint connecting to the bridge snapped off near the working headphone.The second one now has a broken wire, but _INSIDE_ the bridge (how does that make sense?). I still have the bridge component to the other one, so hopefully swapping it will give me one working pair of headphones and one very broken pair.Other than the durability issues, this is a great headset. For $80, though, I expect things to last longer than a year. I give 2/5 stars because things that are broken dont even get a chance to be reviewed in the other areas.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's ""Straight up"" and ""Wish you were here"" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. ""Golders Green"" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. ""Dawn"" is a beutiful Psych ballad,""Makes me feel so good"" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too frustrating for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page (""color all the squares blue""). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is set up around a theme of ""save the stars"". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them ""wander at will"" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Such a great idea! Too bad it never worked consistently, and eventually not at all. It got to a point after being used maybe 10 times tops, that I would have to flip the switch off and then on again to get it to work.

TONE_POLARITY,"This chime is a good idea suffering odd execution. The solar motor chugs a weight around to the top of a circle and then allows it to drop to bottom of the circle, moving a small glass prism around and around quickly, striking three chimes. Well, when the weight drops there is clunking sound followed by a muted melodic of the chimes. Clunk, chimes, Cluck, chimes. Is it Frankenstein protesting his innocence? Unfortunately, it has come too late for Rube Goldberg as he would certainly have enjoyed this convoluted way of striking chimes presaged by a loud warning of the wonderful innovation.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm an O'Reilly fan, but I was very disappointed with 'The No Spin Zone'. It just didn't have the bite, clarity, and concision of O'Reilly's first book, 'The O'Reilly Factor'. As I read this I kept coming back to one thought: his publisher really wanted a successful followup book, but O'Reilly couldn't think of a good topic - so he had no topic. Some of the show transcripts included in the book are interesting, but they don't translate well to print since so much of O'Reilly's banter with his guests is about intonation and subtext. My suggestion: buy 'The O'Reilly Factor' and read it a dozen times, and begin watching 'The O'Reilly Factor' on FoxNews whenever possible. And leave 'The No Spin Zone' on the shelf.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said "" The never before told story"" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other ""authors"" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This is a basic watch with Atomic setting. I bought it at the $20 Gold box special price. Don't pay more. It does not have back light and no other features except time and date display. The wrist band does not adjust. I do not have thick wrists (6 ft tall) and the band is tight and has to stretch a little while sitting on my wrist. Nice thing is it does not rip off my arm hair. If you have thicker wrists it will be in a tight stretched position. The display is nice but has no back light. If it had backlight I'd be happy at the 20 dollars. Feel I bought a toy watch with automatic atomic setting.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The book is a broad and detailed manual covering the entire list of restoration steps and processes, but what the book fails to account for are manufacturing differences created by the various GM assembly plants. An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state ""the part appears this way and this way only"" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference. I certainly hope this book is never used to judge concours Chevelle restorations.For the restorer wishing to learn great deals of general information about restoring a Chevelle, this can be a good reference tool, it just needs to be taken with a grain of salt not not used as the sole source of restoration information.",,0

And they work flawlessly everywhere in our apartment. There is no loss of performance or static anywhere. Three speakerphones (each handset as well as the base) is a great convenience. Also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.The answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use. Was surprised to read that the message capacity is approximately ten minutes, and consider this a limitation. Most of the current machines have a capacity of 15 to 30 minutes. However, if we keep up with the answering machine on a daily basis, the ten minute capacity should suffice.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The traditional boys' preparatory school, a sort of 'mini-public school' which prepares boys for entry to proper public schools at the age of 13, is a very British institution, so it came as a surprise to this English reader to find that this book was published in Washington DC. However, the American perspective upon the subject provided by the authors is to be welcomed. Also welcome are the numerous photographs, beautifully capturing an educational ethos which is now, somewhat sadly, in decline. The limited number of stunning colour plates show how even more impressive the book would be if printed throughout in colour. However, considering the modest price of the book one must not grumble too much: there is much here to reward the mind and delight the eye.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The title just about says it all. Not that pushups, burpees and punches aren't great exercises, but do you really need to buy a DVD to tell you ""Do 30 seconds of X. Now do 30 seconds of Y.""There doesn't seem to be much thought given to the sequencing or timing of the intervals, and there is little to no actual technique instruction. Plus, the three workouts follow a goofy upper body, lower body, whole body split, which is presumably borrowed from body building, but makes no sense in martial arts training where movements are not designed to isolate muscle groups.Hackleman's second home work out DVD ""Crosspit"" fixes many of these shortcomings and is a much better product.",,0

In fact, if you are already using a round brush to take the frizz out of your hair I would recommend that you stick to that method.

They are pretty good, but I was in a hurry and hoped that the Visual Quickstart Guide would live up to its title. Regretfully, the Visual Quickstart Guide merely rehashes the same information that is available in the User Guide. In most cases, I found the User Guide's explanations to be clearer than those in this book. The author seems to have forgotten a basic principle - a book on a software product must add value to the product's included documentation. I found Visual Quickstart guide to be worthless in that regard. Eventually, I gave up on it and simply used Filemaker's manuals.",,0

If you are a light sleeper, you will not be able to sleep in the same room with your child in these beds. Every time they shift or roll-over they make a horribly loud noise. I have tried piling on additional blankets and comforters on top, which hasn't worked. Additionally, after only 2 or 3 uses one of them will not hold air. These beds are going in the trash and will be replaced by something less expensive and quieter.

It's shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states ""An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN"" has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can't be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!!

TONE_POLARITY,"This book celebrates its 60th birthday this year but it's difficult to top it for the most straightforward, comprehensive overview of the curriculum process. There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs (""Teaching for quality learning at university"") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read.

TONE_POLARITY,"John Lewis chronicles his ascendancy from the backroads of Alabama to the hallowed halls of Congress - an experience which reads more like carefully contrived fiction than real life events. The struggles, the triumphs, the emotions, the meanings are all skillfully woven to create a soon-to-be American classic literary canon, depicting the Civil Rights Movement. Lewis, described as an American treasure, lives up to the title with his intimate details of the renown leaders of the movement and the not-so-well-known heroes, who fought tirelessly and courageously to end the social injustices of the segregated South. Twenty-first century textbook authors would be remiss, if not negligent, by not including the perspectives of Lewis' Walking with the Wind. Amazingly, Lewis remains humble, despite his successes. He is a role model, and more importantly, a 20th Century American hero. Walking with the Wind is a must-read for all.",,1

She goes on and on and on about how the Rede says ""Harm none,"" yet she details a spell for a successful deer hunt! Wow, is hunting deer not harming it? Yes in fact the act of KILLING is indeed the act of HARMING! Ravenwolf is no different that the hypocritical christians that stand for hours in anti-abortion lines and then, when it's all over, they run to the nearest fast food restaurant for a quick burger!

TONE_POLARITY,"Tooth and Nail and its associate labels continue to make great leaps in the quality and variety of acts they are signing. The X series of CDs and DVDs could be considered those labels' greatest hits from the last recording year, with a few dips into earlier seasons. Most of the tracks on this DVD are more Christian inspired rock than outright praise and worship; but there are some real gems of His wisdom throughout. Some of the tracks are making headway on the secular scene like Thousand Foot Krutch's ""Move"" that was used on ESPN. Overall a tight effort. If you are already into Christian rock/hard-rock/hip-hop/metal, this is a must-add to your collection. If you want a good sample of where Christian rock is going these days, this will give you a chance to find bands that suit your taste. In short, this DVD rocks. Buy it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: ""Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense."" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"".

The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record.",,1

I suppose this impression is further enhanced by some of the selections (""Oh, Lady Be Good"", ""Avalon"", ""Shine"" and ""Rosetta"" for example) and the small group consisting of unidentified xylophone (reminding me of Red Norvo), guitar, bass and drums.Except for two obvious selections , there is nothing to identify this with New Orleans but this is still a very enjoyable small group swing set.",,1

They meet again at a writer's conference, over 25 years later. Ultimately, Thomas learns that there are consequences to his decisions, missed opportunities, time lost. The story was a disappointment, too slow paced, the only excitement - the denouement at the end. The story labors over Thomas' feelings, but there is little elaboration on Linda's feelings - her personality seems flat, almost indifferent. The story reads like a bleak rainy day.",,0

The performances and orchestra are rather bland, and the sound quality is quite bad, with significant tape hiss and muddled frequency ranges throughout -- perhaps if this were 20-bit remastered to current standards, it would be more competitive. Only recommended for those who *must* have all 4 of Karajan's sets -- it's not truly terrible, by any stretch, but it's mediocre, and at this price you can do far better elsewhere.If you're looking for a ""vintage"" (1940's or earlier) Beethoven set, try Furtwangler (my personal fave), or perhaps Toscanini.

Not only were the characters watered down, dull, and one-dimensional (in fact, they're mere shadows of the characters they were in Poly-Matrix), but the plot was dull and uninsprired, and the thing was so full of badly done and even more badly integrated CGI that I had to cover my face in disgust every time it came on. The English dubbing was so awful I had to change it to the Japanese just so I could stand it. Just buy Poly-Matrix and pretend that they never made this disappointing sequel.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"WAY less game play than either GTA (the violence is cleaner and not bloody, but there is just as much of it). I'd say maybe 10 to 20 hours, max, less if you're obsessive with it. The modeling and movement are good, but there are holes in the plot (I thought it was supposed to be a stand alone story, but there are major plot flaws if that's so.) that are only filled by the movie. Also, when you finish the limited game play, it ends with a great big movie ad for the next movie due out later this year. That's pretty crass. All in all, while there are some aspects of this virtual environment that show promise, it seems like expensive cross-merchandising more than a real video game. Oh well.",,0

Orlando Bloom is HOTT and Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious. There's so much action and it just doesn't stop. This movie doesn't lack anything. It has adventure, romance, comedy, great graphics, scary moments, fantasy,and most important Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. I give it 5 STARS. I'ld give it more but I'm not allowed. No other Pirate movie will be able to compete. I will for sure be buying this movie. If I were you I wouldn't miss this one.",,1

A great soundtrack should not carry the movie, but the mood, and the eclectic, shall I say, whimsical, nature of this collection really brings out the scenes. Even as one listens to the soundtrack alone after seeing the flick, details of the relevant scenes pop up. There is an incredible amount of energy here, and there has to be, to keep up with the disjointed, parallel-plotted movie. This soundtrack has the feel of a road-trip mix made by a friend of diverse musical tastes.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"My Labrador Retriever just LOVES this plush, over-sized bone-shaped toy, although it is NOT A CHEW TOY as my Lab has 'opened' it a couple of times over 6 mos. and we've had to sew it back closed. In spite of this, she LOVES the stuffed bone so much that the sewing occasionally is worth it. In terms of value, it is certainly worth <$10, but when you add 50%+ more for S&H it becomes borderline in terms of value. So I would give it 3-stars (OK product for $$) but my Lab would give it 5-paws up as it is one of her favorite toys to run and play with. But we've had to limit any tugging with it as the seams just do not hold up to too much strain. For tugging with a big dog, try 3 Knot Tug Rope Bone - White (24 inch) which has been very durable for tug play.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I know people always say that a new album is the band's ""best yet"", just because it is new. However, I say this after much thought. The band MxPx has left behind some of the pure punk heard on ""Pokinatcha"" or ""Teenage Politics"" and went more the way of the buffalo. Instead of the fuzzy guitar riffs, and hyperactive drums, we have polished pop-punk and hyperactive drums. A great tradeoff.Most of the songs on this album have the catchiness of ""I'm Okay, You're Okay"" or ""The Downfall of Western Civilization"". The best cuts on this album are ""Responsibility"" and ""The Next Best Thing"".If you are a fan of MxPx, or even of Blink 182, Gob, Less than Jake, or other similar bands, pick up this album: you won't regret it.PxPx!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Just like the month of March, this book started out like a lion and ended up like a lamb. Written before 9/11, there were places which made me cringe in light of that tragedy. But forget that the story line after the first two chapters was so far beyond fiction with a hundred submarines gaining entry into New York Harbor undetected and landing all these Chinese troops. Many of the characters proved to be very annoying and contributed nothing to the story. I wondered why some of them even existed in the book. The action was - for the most part - completely implausible. There were a few places that held the reader's interest, but only a few. Ideas were introduced and disappeared instead of being developed in the plot. I kept turning pages to see if it got better. It didn't. And after 400+ pages leading to a climax, the ending came very abruptly and ridiculously in less than 10 pages. Don't bother reading this one.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm sorry, but the great serious issues at the heart of this film are simply swamped by odd and often hilarious acting, reactions, edits and transitions. Like the boat, the participants are wooden and sterotyped. The black man is ""put in his place"" by Tyrone Powers, who shouts him into subserviance; later, he sings a spiritual - no kidding. There's the Italian hood with a switchblade, the officious army commander, the loose woman, the professor, and Mary Ann! No kidding, they are all there, 26 of 'em. Even Tyrone gets the treatment as our conflicted hero. The loose woman gives us the defining aside on Tyrone: ""THERE'S a MAN!""I rated this not zero, or one star - but I gave it two, simply because this is an absolute stitch to watch. It means well, it is so earnest. For that alone it surely deserves notice as a serious hoot.Now, back to bailing...",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This movie was well produced and has a beautiful, semi-fantastical setting (almost more like a village in France than India). The acting and cinematography were both very interesting, with some beautiful shots. However, it lacked the light-hearted comedy and story that attracts independent American viewers. My wife and I love seeing Indian movies about the conflicts between traditional Indian society and modernity. In these movies, the family is both part of the plot and oftentimes comic relief. However, I didn't laugh once during this film. It's a serious love story, but mixed with the dancing and fairy tale setting, it's hard to take seriously.A related problem is that this movie simply had too much singing and dancing. I know Bollywood movies tend to have a lot of singing and dancing, but at times this movie seemed to have more music video scenes than plot. I ended up fast-forwarding these sequences.",,0

The version of Feel Like a Stranger has no jamin like it did later on. Songs like Alabama Getaway, Lost Sailor, and Easy to Love You, just are plain boring.

Trust me, now THAT'S a real next generation console. The graphics may not be as great as ps3 or x360, but if you buy games only because the graphics, then maybe video games aren't for you and you should stick to DVDs.

You won't guess ""who done it"" until you're told in the very last pages.As with all the Jane Austen mysteries, you'll find yourself enjoying the style and historical footnotes as much as the mystery itself. Ms. Barron has mastered imitating the voice of Restoration ""ladies"" books and scrupulously researched the customs of the early 19th century.

One thing that was nice knowing, was that the authors were the actual detectives assinged to the case. This means it's true to life, no embelishing! One slow part in the book was the hours of tapes that were meaningless to the story that the FBI explianed. This is what kept me from giving the book five stars.

Yes it is gory but that's this particular reader's preference. Sure it is ugly and I read to be shocked. And I was. I found it took me a little while to get into this book, hence my decision to give it 4 stars. However, once the author had grabbed my attention, she had it - I couldn't put the damn thing down! Halfway through, a major plot change happened and left me thinking ""What the heck?"" and I couldn't wait to finish it. I loved this book. I gave it to a friend of mine - and she too has the same opinion.

TONE_POLARITY,THE CONTENDER I would recommend this novel because it is really good there is and it is somewhat short. In it there is this guy and his friend James and he breaks into this store and he gets caught and he goes to jail. Then the people that were with James found Alfred because they thought he told on them but he didn't then he ran into Donatelli gym and taught him to box. I liked this book I really think you might like it too.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I loved both Red Dragon and Silence, and this was such a let down. The entire plot was ridiculous, and the ending, well, that was beyond silly. In addition, I just didn't get into any of the characters - Starling was too much of a patsy, Lecter was boring, and Verger, although he did have the makings of a good character, was just too over the top. Either Harris felt pressured to write a sequel that he really didn't want to write, or he was just darn lucky on his first two attempts. I think that most Silence fans will be incredibly disappointed.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"What a little gem, and at a bargain price!! Originally released in 1970, at the dawn of the ""progressive rock"" era, this instrumental recording is short on the pomposity that marred alot of stuff from that time, but is high on whimsy and laid-back, otherworldly atmosphere. Lots of cheesy organ and fuzz-box guitar, along with tribal drumming. I'm gonna have to play this one on Halloween night - it'll be perfect.",,1

Somethings I did find annoying like the ""late night infomercial"" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times.

I picked and chose the information that I felt was accurate and went from there. I wouldn't recommend this book alone.

It constantly sticks and you have to use a lot of strength at times to pull it out and I always feel like I'm going to break it. You also really have to jam it back in and water sploshes out when you do. It is also a very small reservoir. It only hold enough for a small to maybe medium size cup. I like to make a large cup of hot tea, but it doesn't hold enough water. I just don't like it and would never purchase this again.",,0

We now have beautiful mountain pictures that we can enlarge and print. I've already done some printing and the pictures look like 35mm photos. I have read that some people complain about having to process the pictures through special software. We tried this processing, but didn't see a difference. We have very vivid color just using our regular photo editor. It isn't time consuming to use the Minolta software though. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this as a motorcycle helmet lock, for which it works great except the lock itself is is totally cheap. I don't even care so much about the level of security, as this is just a deterrent so somebody can't easily walk off with my helmet; but locking it and unlocking it takes forever. To unlock, when you turn the key it doesn't just release or even disengage so you can pull the pin out, you have to wiggle the key to get it to disengage, and at the same time wiggle the pin while tugging. Then to lock it, it's just as difficult. You don't need the key, but the pin doesn't fit well and has to be wiggled and forced. Like I mentioned, this type of lock with this length of cable is perfect to use as a motorcycle helmet lock,but I would shop around for one with a better lock. The only thing I would add is both the lock and cable are wrapped in a rubber casing and shouldn't scratch your motorcycle, which is why I chose this model. However, for $5 you get what you pay for.",,0

They arrived at the house and I was so excited because we have two boston terrier dogs and I wanted a shirt that kind of represented them.The XXL fit fine in the arms and shoulders but was super small at the bottom to where it barely even could be pulled down without hearing a tearing sound. The XL was made the exact same way. My partner took the XXL even though it is huge in the arms and shoulders because it fit better at the bottom. We gave the XL to our neighbor's son and he could wear it but it was also huge at the top but fit him at the bottom.The company got in touch with me after I reviewed them and offered me 25% off of my NEXT purchase with them if I would remove my negative feedback.

TONE_POLARITY,"I won't weigh in on the merits of the work itself--it is fine for my taste, though not to others. But you ought to be warned that the narration for the unabridged edition, by Donal Donnelly, is deplorable. He reads with almost comically exaggerated vocal inflections. He often pauses after ever few words (sometimes after every single word) so that you can hardly follow the flow of the ideas. I found it so annoying that I had to stop listening, though I was engaged by the book itself. This criticism does not apply to Liam Neeson's reading of the abridged edition--I haven't heard it, but it seems to get good reviews.

""A Desparate Kurama: A final Measure""), so the first half of the episode has the introduction subtitle stuck at the bottom of the screen. This is the ONLY reason why it lost a star from me. But to be really honest, if you watch the English version, then go back and watch the Japanese, it doesn't make a lot of difference ^_^The final round, the fight between Team Urameshi and Team Tugoro, is finally beginning, and the battle between Karasu and Kurama is the most beautiful fight in the world, so this is still definately worth buying.

TONE_POLARITY,"I picked this up on vinyl at a used record store back in the mid-70's and was blown away by the unique approach to their music via Jerry Goodman on violin. I never cared much for the ""horn bands"" of the early 70's, like Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears. However, the Flock was different and had a edge to them that was quite appealing. Unfortunately, the Flock got little commercial exposure and usually played alot of the festivals going on at the time. The Flock was more appreciated by other musicians than by the average listener. The funny thing is when people saw them live, they usally liked them. It goes to show you success is not just measured by talent or the Flock would have been at the top of the ladder. The Flock's style is a mixture of Rock, Jazz, Classical & Folk that creates a sound that is raw and polished at the same time. The Flock is one of the best bands that never really ""made it"".",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Having first gotten to know The White Dog Cafe in my frequent meals there during college, I was delighted (understatement) to find that the restaurant had its own cookbook. The book, which is a solid thickness with plenty of recipe options, is one of my very favorites. There are items that are more complicated and others that are perfect for a backyard BBQ. Variety being key and inside bits of information adding to the richness of this book. For instance, in a recipe calling for fresh artichokes, the page would give you a little information on cleaning fresh artichokes. The kind of background many cooks need and most cookbooks neglect to offer. I would give this cookbook a five-star rating, but I am allergic to about 25% of its recipes so I can't say how great those are.

Each sub-chapter is synopsized with summary bullets called ""Lincoln Principles"" that highlight the cogent thoughts of that section.""Lincoln on Leadership"" is a good primer to provide a basic overview of leadership principles, and will not be useful for teaching about advanced leadership topics. However, Phillips' use of relevant examples from Lincoln's life made the book applicable to a number of leadership scenarios and made this book very enjoyable.",,1

In one part a man is trapped in a store with his son, his wife is at home miles away and probably dead, so he decides to sleep with another woman. What this had to do with the story or the plot is beyond me.Don't get me wrong, I've been a Stephen King fan since I first started reading thrillers, you could even say that he is my favorite writer.

TONE_POLARITY,"Simple plot but a nice change of pace considering his path of Westerns and soon to be string of Dirty Harry cop films, Eastwood is every bit his own man in this mountain climbing adventure. The film is based on a novel by Trevanian, and surrounds the story of a man sent with 3 other climbers. He is blackmailed to execute one of them while climbing with them in the Swiss Alps. Stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be Jonathan Hemlock's friend. Eastwood plays the part of Hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by Eastwood himself! The drama that unfolds on the climb in the alps is nothing short of spectacular, and this is definitely a must see for Eastwood fans of a younger generation of his films that might have missed it the first time.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I loved BR movie and would tell all my friends about it. But this....This is crap. For some reason I just had to read the first 3 books but now I have officialy stoped reading. The character development is very good but one thing that keeps this from being good. ITS WAY TO GRAPHIC FOR ITS TASTE! I know it says Mature on the back but still jeez! I mean you see some much brains and intestince get shot or pulled out. For an example Shuyas orphin brother gets shot in the cheek and you see a graphic picture of him laying on the ground with a huge whole with his tung sticking out. And than the teacher finishes him off by shooting him between the eyes. Its extreamly violent. And when you get to the last chapter on this lets just say if your into Hardcore Pornagraphy than you'll like this. This book went waaay overboard. But its in your taste what you like.

TONE_POLARITY,"It's a trademark of Danny Boyle's films to show humans clinging to hope even in the worst possible circumstances---just think of the ending of Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.Sunshine follows a similar pattern, with seven astronauts and scientists attempting to reignite a dying sun by means of a stellar bomb, thereby saving the Earth. That this could mean their own deaths is something that probably weighs on their minds as much as on the viewer's.The film will also put one in mind of Alien, with the confining space of the ship and the intimacy of a small group. There's even a nod to Silent Running, with the greenhouse/oxygen garden on board.The film might have benefited by the inclusion of some bits of backstory on these people and maybe some transmission from their families back on Earth.

TONE_POLARITY,"The only other review at the time of this posting is rather unfair, probably because the author misunderstood the purpose of the book. It is a guide for walking the streets of Paris to look at buildings. It is not a coffee-table book. Hence the relative paucity of illustrations. Hence the use of actual French names for buildings and places. (How else would you find them? The signs are not in English. And the reviewer obviously found translation no problem.) And the maps are certainly adequate for finding your way. They show excellent small-scale detail. Perhaps the only ""fault"" of the book is that it is so compendious and the information so complete that it takes some study to plan your day.

This bar gives a good, all-natural energy jolt when a snack is in order at home or the office, without the empty calories of chips and candy. Definitely Recommended. Four ORGANIC Stars!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I have taught at both the Middle and High School levels and found that Illuminations by Jonathan Hunt is a wonderful way to introduce the medieval period to young adults. This book is not just a childrens book. Illuminations introduces the students to important vocabulary words relating to the Middle Ages in a fun and visually stimulting manner. The author takes each letter of the alphabet and associates it with something medieval. The illustrations are breathtaking and compliment the students understanding of what illuminations were all about. I highly recommend this book to young and old alike.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I read this a while ago and enjoyed it immensely. It's a story about women who are adjusting to having or not having kids. One of the characters is referred to as ""Yoga Barbie"" because of her blonde hair and perfect body, but she is struggling with her unemployed husband. Another woman is trying to get over the loss of her own baby, who died.The most memorable character is Becky, who is probably modeled on Weiner herself - a spunky, overweight woman who meets life head-on and has an answer for everything. Becky's accounts of meeting her husband, the early days of their relationship, and their sexual problems in the beginning, are tragicomic. Her skirmishes with her mother-in-law are also entertaining and the outcome is enlightening.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic ""flashbacks"" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one ""enlightened"" person mentioned in the book had ""higher"" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible.",,0

""Diseases"" are being created where none exist to promote the industry, and a deadly industry it can be.Christian Science and spiritual healing, in my opinion, are far less likely to do harm, and doing no harm was the original committment of the physician.

For small speakers the sound is very good. They have a very wide frequency range and I compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. I don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. I used on the floor and now they are perched on 30"" stands.

The thing I like best is that the there's a lot of variety in the production, the classics sound great, and the originals are nice too, like the excellent ""Christmas Time Without You"", and one which sounds like it could have been a newly discovered track from a ""Christmas with Elvis"" session.

Other victories seem to turn on him at the same time. Hob-knobbing with the weathly, which at first seemed to benefit his order, turns into a nightmare in which he remembers his duty at just the last minute.

It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research. He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism. His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I've owned a lot of coffeemakers, but this one is about perfect.A) The price is great, relative to similar products.B) The carafe maintains a great temperature, without any complex sealing apparatus -- to pour, you simply pour. Even partially empty, the carafe maintains a satisfactorally hot temperature (if not piping, but the laws of thermodynamics are what they are)for a couple of hours. I've never tried leaving it completely full to test maximum heat retention, but I suspect it might go 3-4 hours.C) It has an automatic shutoff, a clear window to watch the reservoir fill, and an overall design that is both contemporary and compact.Really, there's no reason to buy a maker with a burner anymore, no reason for burnt coffee. This is all you can ask for, really.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It does its job, but it smells sooooo horrible. I prefer using a cotton swab instead of my fingers, because it leaves a bad medicine-like smell (fortunately, it fades after a bit). It's not really creme/lotion like... it's more of a watery, diluted creme.I've only use it for a week and I use it once after I shower and once before I sleep. So far, the irritation/itching has been minimal. Does its job, for the most part.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Finally, a wonderful, comprehensive resource to help the average person, who wants to make the change to a healthier lifestyle! I've always felt overwhelmed, with so much conflicting information as to what's safe and what's not. I found out about this book, from the Weston A. Price website - another awesome resource for finding out the truth. The absolute best part of this book, for me (because, honestly, a lot of the ""chemical"" details are over my head) - are the lists, at the back, of specific products (in each category - hair, face, deoderants etc) that have been tested as absolutely safe. This was so helpful, for me... to have all the research and legwork done, and to be able to simply look up each category, and find out where to buy it. It allowed me to slowly and methodically eliminate my family's personal care products that were harmful and, confidently, replace them with safe ones. The website offers ongoing updates on newly added ""Safe"" products. This is an excellent gift.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display. Burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. I will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if Peter Coyote (narrator) is a little dry.Do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard DVD version with this series.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"It is good because it makes you think, it's not just there for pure intertainment. I also like the depth of the book and the details. It also lets you think on your own, letting you have your own opinions while she has hers. I highly recommend it to people who like to think.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,Fiction folks. This is another fiction by the same writer. Kids who have no knowledge of the reality of the Pagan beliefs eat this stuff up. As all the other books like this I doubt there is a claim by the writer or publishers that it was meant to be taken literally or even seriously. Kids do though so it keeps them busy with make-believe until they grow up and remember these reads so they can become interested in the real thing. Just hopefully it won't lead to them becoming interested in the negative things that are often associated with occult matters. Sometimes kids can't seperate the differences. That is my only objection to these writings. But for the most part kids are pretty smart today and most know these types of books are nothing more than entertainment. I only am concerned about the ones who are looking to fit into something and maybe go too far.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,would buy another. Works to charge ps3 controller and droid razr at the same time while playing them both. so you should buy it too.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,Some beautiful cinephotography is the best thing about this rather pedestrian retelling of the Easter story with a twist.It is rather cliche ridden and far too clean for a dramatic realistic retelling. A rather sparkling Eurocast of actors with a rather good unexpectedly performance from Dolph Lundgren but in the final analysis there is not too much of substance to this movie.I am sure that it will catch the moment just before Easter but it will probably be as quickly forgotten as a Cadbury Creme Egg.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"About a month ago, I purchased 2 of those ladybugs for my boys. The kids love them; the only problem is that they seem to be poorly made: I had gotten 2; neither one was very bright; then the green light went out in one, less than one month after having purchased them (apparently you can't replace the bulbs). I went through Amazon and the replacement came in last Tuesday (brighter than the first one); I returned the one with the broken light by mail today - and just now the new one (which was much brighter than the first two) wouldn't turn off nor change colors when pushing the buttoms on the wings. I then turned it off completely and now it won't turn back on at all.As stated above, the kids love them, but I don't want to have to continuously return them, so I am going to research other ones.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Fiona Cheng is an eleven year old American girl with a Chinese father and a Scottish mother. She is ""half and half"" as she puts it, but is starting to realize that her identity is more complicated than two halves making a whole. Performing in her town's folk festival, Fiona wants to represent both of her halves but scheduling conflicts cause her to have to choose a side. Fiona's solution to her problem helps her realize that everyone has something different to offer about their own unique identity. Namioka's chapter book depicts a struggle to fit in that her readers will relate to, however her reflections on being biracial are at times too perceptive. Fiona's sophisticated musings on her racial identity sound more like a parent's contemplation on her mixed race child than her own. Written in a sometimes tediously moralizing tone, biracial readers of Half and Half may not find a character they can truly identify with.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I love adventure puzzle games and this did not disappoint! It really is more scary than you would think and all without a lot of the gore that frankly sickens me that you see in many computer games and movies. Reminiscent of the older scary ghost story movies that can create a chill up your spine and many looks over your shoulder. Really engrossing and like many of the other reviewers I found it a lot shorter than I'd like. Please game creators, give us a sequel and make it much longer! I, for one, would be willing to pay the extra money!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"A Massive Attack fan to the death, I was sorely disappointed by this collection of videos. Since the release of ""Mezannine,"" I would say that Del Naja has become the Bono of the early-mid nineties: pompous and a bit self-righteous. Where I would have hoped to see some experimental music video directing, this collection is mostly a jumbled together collection of cheesecake closeups of the ever-scowling 3-D. Advance listenings of ""100th Window"" portends more pseudo-art from this great band. One expects more from the greatest band of the late twentieth century.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"A year in the life of a teenage girl named Jessica Darling. Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away. Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next. This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it. If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Those who read the book knows that the movie is not 100% accurate. This really annoys me.In the book, Francis Dollarhyde was supposed by really ugly. Ralph Fiennes does not seem to be ugly. In fact, he was more good looking. This is important because it is one of the reasons why he is messed up. His mom left him because of what he looked like and thus his grandma took care of him. That's why he still lives in his grandma's house. Anyway, there is more to Francis' background.......BUT WHERE WAS THIS IN THE MOVIE????There was barely any info on Francis' life. That's why audiences are like, ""what the heck? why is he like this?""Hint of advice for movie creators- Read and understand the importance of the book!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"It's very interesting to see how this extremely entertaining biography reads in comparison to the classic movie it served as the catalyst for. Wiseguys is engaging. You really begin to feel as if you come to know Henry Hill and the various Gumbas he introduces you to throughout the pages.If you've seen Goodfellas you will certainly find the combination of certain characters from the book into one character for the movie interesting also. Screenwriters will enjoy how Martin Scorcese altered aspects of the book to make the story flow on screen.Many pieces of Henry Hill's dialogue were magnificently voiced over word for word in a brilliant performance by Ray Liotta. A credit to Scorcese and Liotta. Many alleged ""gurus"" shun voice over in movies. But when used properly, as in Goodfellas, the results are classic. And we wouldn't have that classice if it weren't for Mr. Pileggi documenting the life of Henry Hill here in Wiseguy.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I wouldn't recommand Species II to anyone. The creation of this movie is only due to the sucess of the first, there shouldn't be any reason for watching this movie except for Natasha Henstridge's boobs. What they want to make was an erotic alien movie but they simply forgot to structure a more convincing story, instead it's just a weak movie with tons of sex scenes to make up for the lame plot.

This administration and the fools who back it are all LIARS who don't follow what's really going on. Great job Al Franken and the team from Harvard! I salute you as a true American. Only we true Americans know what's really going on! For you Bush backers, WAKE UP from your Walmart-shopping stupor!

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this collection solely for the DVD. I have all of the music from the CD on various collections and it is indeed great music. I was hoping that the DVD was going to show many clips of his performances. Instead you get two video clips from a movie - the first clip is not even two minutes long and the second clip ""Concerto For Clarinet"" (a great song that is over nine minutes long), taken from the movie at about three minutes. There was a ""School of Swing"" segment that was ok, but nothing great. I can't believe that these are the only good clips available. The interview session is also just ok and after viewing it once I don't think you'll ever go back to it. Where's the performances???? There is nothing special here except the price - it's too high!!! If I was just rating the music it would get five stars. However I believe that most folks will make this purchase because of the video. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.",,0

If you fill one to the brim, it is 8 ounces. I can't imagine how they arrived at the very specific (yet apparently arbitrary) 5.625 number.My two key criteria were that (1) I was looking for a glass that would hold around 6oz and (2) I wanted it to be tall and slender.

Antonio Tibaldi directs this story about a dysfunctional family and its secrets, particularly Jimmy`s past, AKA ""Little Boy Blue"" (played by Ryan Phillippe). Despite the mysterious tone of the film, which offers some surprises along the way, this is an average effort overall, since the pacing is too slow at parts and the ending isn`t too satisfying. The acting is convincing, though (John Savage, Natassja Kinski), so this offbeat coming-of-age tale still deserves a watch.Not bad but not good enough either.",,0

To me it was a nice film,a little too long though,with good killings,nice weird characters,nice costumes and anyway something different for a european who is used to european and american film-making. worth to see it once.but...tha extraordinary,fantastic and brilliant part of the movie was the weirdo-bard that was singing every once in a while with his guitar...his songs were great!!! the movie worth buying or hiring just to listen to those songs! Please does anybody knows how can i find those tunes???? please help!!!send me an e-mail or something.. :)",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"First off, let me say that I think BLONDIE is one of the best bands ever. Period. But this concert comes to us from a very low point in their career. Back in 1982, BLONDIE was on its last legs (the first time around). They all hated each other, Frank Infante was suing the band and has been last-minute replaced by some black guy. Chris Stein was at the beginning stages of a disease that almost killed him - and it shows. Debbie had already released a solo album at this point and looks very bored. Even BLONDIE didn't like themselves at this stage in the game.If you are a big fan, you will want to pick this up as a timepiece. But if you are trying to get a video that will capture the energy of ""Call Me"" or ""One Way Or Another"" - for God's sake - steer clear of this depressing monstrosity of a concert!! There are much better choices out there!!",,0

Occasionally, the author tries to recreate scenes and conversations on a pretty slim set of facts, supposing what may have motivated very private people she never met.Oh, and Dean Acheson was not *Under-Secretary* of State! Did this woman read anything about diplomacy, the Cold War, or Washington society between 1940 and 1965? How could she and her copy editor not know that Dean Acheson was our Secretary of State, and a major figure in post-war Washington?Washington was a very exciting place to be -- but you won't get the full description of those times in this book. too bad.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this item to replace another air cleaner that I was using. This unit didn't work correctly from the beginning. It would turn off by itself and wouldn't turn back on until you unplugged it and then hit the sleep button (pushing the ""on"" button had no effect). It was also EXTREMELY noisy even in ""low"" mode. I kept it in the very lowest setting as a result which meant it ceirculated very little air and was more or less useless.I lived with it for a few months. Now the timer on the screen indicates the filter needs to be cleaned. After I cleaned the filter, I followed the directions to reset the counter, but pushing the ""reset"" button doesn't return the screen to show 100% clean filter. After two days of trying the screen still flashes 0% and indicates the filter should be replaced.Now that the unit refuses to turn back on at all, so I guess it is going to the trash can.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This is a prime example of why I stopped reading Johanna Lindsey's books in the 80s. I would hazard a guess that her fans like to read the same story over and over and over and over. What else would explain the huge sales for her books, when they are virtually identical? This book is just like Fires in Winter, which is just like A Heart So Wild, which is just like... Well, you get the idea. Face it: Ms. Lindsey writes by template. She uses one plot, changing only the details such as names, places, physical characteristics. The first time she wrote the plot, it was great, then she wrote it at least 10 times in the 80s alone, and probably more than that in the 90s. It wears thin. But, hey, the masses apparently like endless repetition. Personally, I'd rather read a writer who bothers to try different plots, not one who writes a formula every time.

TONE_POLARITY,"David Grossman is an eminent -- if not the best -- current writer in the Hebrew language. In the present book he sets to explore the problems of Palestinians who are citizens of Israel, usually a lesser known aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to people living outside the region. Written in the form of conversations with ordinary Israeli-Arabs intertwined with his perceptive and honest reflections as an Israeli Jew, the book gives a sensitive and fresh view of the issue and an alternative to trite journalistic reporting. Although he paints a picture which may be discouraging, Grossman carefully outlines an optimistic path for a better future.",,1

For another, Doyle published ""A Study in Scarlet"" in ""Beaton's Christmas Annual"", not ""Pearson's"". If an author is going to drop names all over the place he should at least check his facts. There's also a line about James Barrie writing about fairies, but ""Peter Pan"" wasn't created until 1902 (the play came in 1904).

Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort. Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays.

Very nice concept but poor implementation. If you only want to drive through ""highways"" and are on budget then this atlas may be somewhat useful, but probably Michelin Africa regional maps 741, 745 and 746 at 1:4.000.000 scale are better investment. It contains some maps of national parks and town that may be useful. Southern part of this atlas is advertised as 1:1.000.000 scale, however that does not mean it has more details!

It's a crying shame Kilzer never received more acclaim than he did, although he was pretty popular in the Little Rock/Memphis area for a while.

TONE_POLARITY,"Matthew Bourne's Car Man is a simply brilliant redo of the classic opera of the (more or less) same name. The wonderful music is all there, the plot shifted to a western US auto repair shop (from cigars to auto parts, hmmm), and as with all ballet, no spoken dialogue. But I found it simply wonderful to watch, the dancers erotic without a doubt but in a highly entertaining way. If you like the music, or if you like dance, and especially if you like both, give this a try.....",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I won't buy this album, and not because Pual is breaking my heart by abonding trance. I've always respected Paul's career from his roots in hip-hop to his expierments in ambient and his funky drum&bass excursions. His work in trance maybe where he gained his most noterity, but it's by no means his home.I won't buy this album because it's just not good music. I've heard almost every track and with the exception of the single, none of it's interesting. You'll find that every major reviewer in every important music magazine will agree.Its not really a dissapointment. Nobody expected a great artits album from this guy. He may have the pedigree.

TONE_POLARITY,"I found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. More importantly, I don't think this book is really for children. I don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'And he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. It doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. And once the girl becomes a woman, I'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. This author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. ""A Room with a View"" is what you could have called ""Proletarian literature"" in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British ""proper"" society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's ""Remains of the Day"" almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done.",,0

I have been a big Elmore Leonard fan for a long time, but this one fell flat for me.

TONE_POLARITY,"I wanted to read this book because of the controversy it has generated. There are only 7 editors and contributors who wrote this 6 chapter, 170 page ""textbook."" The premise is that this ""textbook"" contrasts intelligent design and Darwinian evolution. In actuality, the book selectively promotes facts and theories that support intelligent design and ignores the other 99% of the existant data. This book is a horrible joke. A religious text masquerading as a scientific textbook. I have to wonder...what do the people who believe this book is credible think about cosmology, particle physics, the rest of the universe out there, and the rest of science that has been discovered in the last 2,000 years. Well, I guess if you make believe it simply doesn't (or even can't) exist, you never have to contemplate it or worry about explaining it. That does make life a lot simpler, doesn't it!

Much to my chagrin I had to leaf page after page reading fake girlish bickering looking for a resoolution of some conflict. Instead all was a mess of events. Did somebody edit the book as to make it more structured? Is Robert Jordan exploring his feminine side and oblitarating it? Is he writing only to fill pages hoping the quality of his first three books will carry him over a few more titles? That, ladies and gentlemen, is what was in my mind at the end of the book, and not at all the fate of any of the characters who have become mere cartoons in a mire of sameness.

Also, you have to select ""Timer Record"" on the remote control or your timer will not record. Then it takes you into DVD mode until your program is on. Other models you just have to turn off and the timer will work. Also, the auto tracking is just terrible on this if it is a tape recorded on another vcr.

Several questions ran through my mind: how does a person continue to live with any humanity at all after such an experience; why does one person live, while all the rest die; what kind of magnetism did Mira have that encouraged people to help her?I've met Mira; she lives here in my home town of Oak Ridge.

You'll love the detail on this or any other Art Asylum Star Trek ship. I hope they make Voyager and DS9 too! These toys are great for collecting and I'm sure kids will love to play with them (but probably not great for small children).

I did see that in this book, but found most of them, save maybe Arlene, amazingly dull and shallow. I wonder if the writer would have been better off to focus on a smaller group, really getting to their deepest levels.I found myself becoming infuriated by the characters inability to say how they really feel.

They work for much more than lasagna, and the handle holds up well to dishwashing and occasional resting on the rim of a hot iron skillet. I don't know what we'd do without them -- all of our other spatulas are now residing in the basement. The best thing is how well they flip 3-egg omelettes made in a small skillet or pancakes laden with fresh berries: the angle combined with the size makes for easy flipping every time. And it does lift out lasagna squares well, but we don't use it for that very often.

The coffee pot has permanent water marks etched into the coffee pot.It also has brown stains on the sides - can't get off. On the outside of the coffee maker itself there are corroded water marks thatdo not wipe off - you have to scrape the build-up off. When you slide the top to pour in the water - there gets to be a build-upof water that gets just crusty. When this is scraped off it just comes right back. I have to ream the coffee maker out monthly ormore since it slows down so much and takes 20 min. to brew a pot. I do the vinegar treatment and then have to brew about 10 potsto get rid of the vinegar smell/taste! So totally unhappy with this coffee pot - I will not buy a Bunn again. The qualityis just poor.

TONE_POLARITY,"I was deeply disapointed by this book. I have seen the movie and it is much better. This book is very wrong and gives sharks a negative picture. Sharks are very rarely known to eat humans, in fact, you are more at risk of getting struck by lightning than by getting eaten by a shark. When sharks do attack humans it is mostly because they have been confused and have mistaken you for other prey. This is why after the shark bites it usually swims away.When people look at the cover of the book, they might think that it will be about a shark who goes on a killing rampage, but the book is not mainly about the shark, most of it is about a lady who wants to get sexually involved (for some unknown reason) to a man other than her husband. This takes away from the excitement and is very boring to read. The conclusion is also very bad because it doesn't end with a sense of finality. It just ends when the shark eats a man and another man that was on the boat with him swims to shore.",,0

If you want psychedlic, go to San Francisco.This CD is a curiosity. It's not really psychedelic. It's more like bubble gum. But it's not very good at that either. This CD is for those who have large 60s collection that they've become bored with and are looking for marginalia. A spin or two with it may get you off the 60s all together. Once you get to this point there really isn't anything more available.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I've purchased this product twice in less than 1 year. While it's very helpful when inflated, after a month or so it won't stay inflated for more than 30 minutes of use. I figured maybe the first one was just a dud, so I purchased another one. I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work (a 45-minute drive)...I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work, it's flat. I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home, and again, it's deflated by the time I get home. I've had the same problem with both of the supports I've purchased. No only is it inexpensive, it's cheap and not worth the air it takes to inflate it twice a day!",,0

I have tried to force my way thru thinking it would get better. It never does. I tried over and over and over.

TONE_POLARITY,"I had high hopes for this book but if you read it you will find nothing that hasn't already been reported elsewhere. Jake Tapper's Down and Dirty had everything this book does, and more. Take this book's big revelation that a Gore advisor started the rumor that Jeb and Katherine Harris were having an affair. Tapper's book already reported that. That Gore was craftily micromanaging the recount effort with an eye toward just recounting counties that were pro-Democrat--Tapper already got all that. And on and on. Sammon makes a big deal about the fact that Gore staffers were happy when they got 1,000 overseas ballots tossed out. But is it news--or surprising--that they were happy? I'm sure Jim Baker and his guys were happy when the US Supreme Court voted the way it did, but I don't need a reporter to tell me that fact as if it were a big, important, revealing secret.If you want the full story, this is not the book. What a disappointment.",,0

I haven't had any problems with scratching and they're nice and heavy in weight. I've also dropped one of them before and it didn't dent or scratch the finish. They're easy to keep clean and since it's a brushed finish, they don't show finger prints or smudges. I have had these for a couple years now and they're still holding up wonderfully, and it's easy to change your decor around them since they coordinate well with most any color you put in there. They're also the perfect size, not to big and overbearing, but not so small you have to refill them often. Love these!",,1

Sure there are lots of dialogues and colorful characters that Terantino fans will love, but it just isn't a great movie. Entertaining as hell, but not a great movie.

The who's, what's, why's and hows are accurately discussed in this book about that mess--who took control of it, and what was done with it. A different look at Ground Zero and those who were thrust in charge of this unique operation. An insight at the interests of those who really had control of the ""pile""--the firemen, the police, and Port Authority police. A fine addition to the real story of 9/11.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,First off this is a seperate movie from the original. Also as much as I love Gena Rowlands I did not like the original Gloria so I dont see everyones fascination with it. On its own I thought this show was great. I saw it on tv very early in the morning so my expectations were low. And I am not a very big fan of Sharon Stone at all but I was very presently surprised by this show. Personally I think this is one of her best roles and I thought she did it wonderfully. I think you should give this show a shot based on its own merits alone. Its not the best movie ever but its definitely not the worst either. So basically its touching/heart-warming and has some good action and definitely worth at least a once over so take a chance and may you also be pleasently surprised.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This book is too saccharine-ridden for any self-respecting child. It mostly makes children gag. I have worked in a library and can count the number of times this book has been checked out on one hand. In fact, the only times this book had to be reshelved is when it was accidentally chosen and left for the librarians to clean up. The book is way to sugary sweet. There is no story and no interesting characters. Even the illustrations are watery and lack substance. There is nothing between the covers to stimulate interest in a child. The only function this book serves is as a therapy tool for severly depressed kids, but this might just worsen the situation. On the whole, this book is to be avoided at all costs",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have an ""older model"" of the 1-Quart Pyrex Measuring Cup, so I have a direct comparison. My original is tall and slender, with thick glass. The new version is short, wide and the glass is thinner. I don't know if this makes a difference, but my problem is thus: When pouring liquid, my new Measuring Cup DRIPS. The spout allows liquid to escape down the outside of the container, often outside my bowl. This is not what I'm looking for when attempting to achieve an exact amount of any ingredient needed in a recipe. However, Pyrex is Pyrex. Great for SO many things, and this is a perfect size container for a million different applications ... thus it's impossible for me to give it less than 2 stars.

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this book after skimming it over in a local store. I wish I had taken a closer look at it. I just came off a 2 week break from work and school. During my break I decided to work on a new model and following along with Mr. Steed's book. This turned out to be frustration hell. The methods in his book are fine if you are into wasting alot of time. Boolean and splines to make a simple character like the one in his book actually doubles your work. You wind up wasting more time cleaning up the errors from following his tutorial. Why he didn't demonstrate the way MOST people in the industry model, which is box modeling, is beyond me. He basicly tries to reinvent the wheel. I found much better tutorials for FREE on the web. Save yourself from learning bad modeling techniques. I happen to also know that Paul Steed DOES NOT model the way presented in the book. This should raise a red flag or two.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The Light in the Forest is about a white boy in the 1800's who is captured by Native Americans as a small child. The book is all about his return to and escape from his white family. It has a very shallow plot and the author seemed to take a very long time explaining a small action or custom. In the beginning, the chapters jump from the viewpoint of the main character, True Son, to that of a soldier who observes his actions. The changing of viewpoints makes the book very hard to follow. I do not think a teen or pre-teen would enjoy this book, though I would recommend it to a younger and more naive group of children who didn't care much for interesting plots or an exciting writing style.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I enjoyed reading this interesting book by Evelyn Waugh. She did an excellent job on the words that she used describing the characters and their moods. At first it was sort of difficult for me to understand but then I started to catch up on what was going on.All of the characters in which Waugh created did an excellent job of making this novel start to smooth out and make it easier to understand.In my opinion Hollywood is a place where there are a lot of movie stars and tourists who go visit there and have a good time.I never heard of it being like some haunted place that many terrible things happen there such as many great people dying.I would recommend this novel to many other people out there who enjoy the type of plot that Evelyn Waugh had set it to be.I myself enjoyed it and I was thrilled to have a chance to write a report on this novel.,,1

The fact that this CD and the DVD-A were released by the same company is one of the biggest anomalies I have come across in all my years of collecting music.Just to clarify based on some replies to my review; The sound quality comparisons I made go far, far beyond the expected differences in sound quality between the CD and DVD-A formats.

TONE_POLARITY,"What can I say...I bought this for my bathroom which is lacking a ventilation fan and has tremendous moisture issues. I left the unit on 24/7 and it worked very well, with the water basin needing to be emptied every 2-3 days. Unfortunately, after 10 months, the unit started just making a buzzing sound and the fan wouldn't work. I tried to open it up and replace the fan, but it turns out the circuit board is cooked. Since I opened up the unit, I voided the warranty and the company won't honor it. What can I say...$50 is a lot of money for 10 months of use.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I received the product promptly. I use it when my hair is wet or I wet the stick if my hair is dry. My sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me.

If you need a good book to read or if you like A Year Down Yonder or A Long way from Chicago you'll like this book.",,1

What at great night in a saloon! There is chemistry which is hard to find in many groups these days. There is creativity which crosses many lines of music including Jazz, Bluegrass, Rock, etc. The musicianship is 5 star and one only has to listen to Bright Place and Last Date to discover the sensual, sexual, creative side of these guys. I hope they stay together and continue to produce this kind of stuff forever. If you don't like what you hear, move south and thaw out.",,1

We'll play with this for at least 30 minutes. The problem is my 3 year old thought she'd use it for teething and with one bite dented in the wood significantly (I got it away from her before she could splinter the wood). There is also a possibility of the baby pinching his fingers in it as the colored wood parts do pull apart and I can't help but wonder just how strong the string holding them together is. The colored pieces of wood are movable and can be twisted into shapes which really interests my son- this does pose a bigger problem of being pinched but so far it hasn't been a problem yet.While is is beautiful and clearly a much better option than plastic it's not the perfect teether in my opinion.",,1

It's fast too.So, it's noisy. So what. It only takes seconds and I don't think you could have such a large motor and quiet.

In the book, words kept on suddenly popping up after something didn't come true, or wasn't different. (3.) The guy is a reporter supposedly. He is constantly flying out to the Middle East and finding messages in the Bible, so when is he ever reporting? (maybe he works for one of those tabloids...?).

It is so cool to watch madonna dance around in the sand with her cow-girl hat on and cow-boy boots. This is one of her best songs and in my opinion it is her best video. When you put it in your computer it comes up just as clear as a DVD would be. It comes in as a full screen!!!! As far as the remixes go, they are are pretty good.

Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. The book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. This book is for those victims and their families!

""Sister Fate"", her obvious ode to Prince, was the first release from this sophomore effort, and a very mundane number that lacked the ummf that the single ""Glamourous Life"" exuded . Next was ""Love Bizarre"" (her 12 minute plus duet with Prince)which actually saved the album from complete ennui and possibly diminished record sales.

I think all of the acting is excellent, and that it perfectly portrays the suburban ennui of Connecticut in the 1970s that, albeit in a different form, still exists to this day. My complaint is this: I searched for ""weather in New Canaan, Connecticut, November 23, 1973"" in Wolfram Alpha recently (Novemebr 23 being the date of the titular ice storm) and the result I got was -- are you ready for this? -- ""temperature average: 48 F, conditions: fog, overcast, cloudy, partly cloudy, few clouds, clear."" That, my friends, is a far cry from an ice storm.

TONE_POLARITY,"Written during the height of the late Tech Bubble, it often seems to have more faith, in a secular way of course, in the imagined promises of technology in general and software in particular. The similes are compelling, and the parallels are intriguing, but there's always some nagging question on what it all means. None of the short-term predictions have come to pass, and the long-term predictions are more in the way of philosophical musings of the author. And, the almost child-like respect for computer simulations is questionable, particularly when presented without any supporting arguments or explanations. Not a book on technology as such, or anything really concrete or otherwise directly useful. Some of the points bring to mind the clashes between the Copenhagen and Gottingen schools when quantum mechanics was being conjured up. A good read for speculative background on artificial intelligence.",,0

When I went back to school on Monday many people had seen it and they all said the same THE ENDING IS BRILLIANT. A must see film for horror and scary movie lovers,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Anyone who likes traditonal Fantasy, be it Lord of the Rings, Shannara, or Recluse, will find this book dull. The story is fast paced...but I couldn't get really involved in what the characters were doing. So much is put on describing magic and it's abilities...the characters are not developed as much as they should be.I bought the first two books thinking the series will be good due to other reviews. I will not be reading book two or the others to follow. I WARN you to be careful with this book. You will either enjoy it or hate it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought the ""Dymo Discpainter"" that prints designs directly on printable CDs but I got very different results depending on the exact blank CDs I was using. I tried 5 or 6 different brands and styles. The last one was advertised as ""glossy"" so I had high hopes for a good result. Well, the ink never dried on that CD and it ""stuck"" to the top lid of the CD jewel case! Then I tried these CDs. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! The image was beautiful. It gives a smooth mirror like finish with all the colors brightly shown. It also dries quickly and the ink doesn't ""stick"" to anything. As far as I'm concerned these are the ONLY printable CDs worth using. They are simply the best made.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"While the EQ Atlas is rich in the lore and stories of Norrath, it falls well short of its intended purpose. The maps are not easy to read or follow, and the beastiary has errors. One example is in the listing for Everfrost Peaks, the atlas says monsters there are lvl 1-15. Icy Orcs and Ice Giants are found in Everfrost Peaks and are considerably higher than lvl 15. I wonder how many other zones are listed with incorrect monster levels? The bottom line is that there are zone maps available on-line that are much better than the ones you will find here.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. Record labels should be shot for releasing trash like this. This is already available as the Live In 99 DVD. Difference is, Live In 99 is the full show; this is edited down to maybe half of that release AND they resequenced the songs to where they are completely out of order from the way there were performed. Example: George doesn't open with Bad To The Bone on Live In 99 but does here. It looks stupid here because he is already sweaty whereas on Live In 99, he opens with Be Bop Grandma and is dry as a bone. Be Bop Grandma appears about halfway through this release, so for him to start out soaking wet and be dry halfway through the show, it's just so inconsistent as to be stupid. The performance is great, but skip this and get the real deal for maximum enjoyment.",,0

If you are ordering this for the praying mantis, make sure you order by April, so you can get the egg cases sent to you before they are out of stock). This is well made and easy enough for a 5 year old to get in and out of to take care of the praying mantis. Its nice because it has a zipper at the top for smaller opening. It has handles to hang as well. The screen is small enough to allow oxygen in and keeps the insects inside nicely. Great for educational learning about nature and other creatures.

I love anime, but I hate it when people make short ""prequels"" to films.The story is how Ichi became a killer. It's a boring, tedious anime short that is filled with ""WTF-was-that-supposed-to-be"" action and gore scenes, and after the good beginning, the film gets worse and worse, filled with plenty of pointless sex scenes (like when Hajime's (Ichi's real name) parents are talking about why he's getting criticized, then out of the middle of nowhere, they start engaging in S&M;) and boring story elements that have nothing to do with Hajime or his background.AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"While Patton had flaws, and they are clearly presented in this excellently-written biography, I found his story full of high interest and one could not help but feel glad that Patton was present when he was on the battlefields where he served. This is an excellent work, well matching the other D'Este works I have read: Decision in Normandy (read 5 July 1992) and Fatal Decision (read 29 June 2003). Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors. But this is a great and enjoyable book to read and I revelled in it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this book at the same time I purchased Protecting the Gift: Keeping Children and Teenagers Safe by Gavin De Becker. I read Never Talk to Strangers first, and was very disappointed. What do camels with bony knees, grouchy grizzly bears, parachuting hawks, a rhinoceros waiting for a bus, coyotes asking the time, and cars with whales at the wheel have to do with teaching my child about strangers - other than their ability to rhyme with the phrase ""Never talk to strangers, please.""?After reading Protecting the Gift, I decided to return this book rather than share it with my 3 1/2 year old daughter, especially after the author specifically mentioned the book Never Talk to Strangers in a chapter about why merely teaching children not to talk to strangers doesn't work.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is the biggest lot of historical nonsense. Sullivan has anirritating style and a gushing attitude towards his subject(either he's related to Ducky or madly in love with her). Hecannot get over how impossibly wonderful, gorgeous, perfect, etche thinks she was. This is a totally inappropriate stance for ahistorian towards a subject. He also trashes everyone Ducky knewto make her look better. Sullivan's treatment of the murderedEmpress Alexandra is particularly cruel and unnecessary. Bottomline: Ducky was an overrated, frumpy, greedy historical footnote.Cyril wanted to be Emperor, so why didn't he start by executingtraitors like himself and his wife?

TONE_POLARITY,"The Reality Dysfunction is a real mixed bag. It's full of great concepts and it's set in an interesting universe. The plot is reasonably engaging, and some of the characters are well done. The writing is at times good, but at other times sloppy. (Hamilton seems to have real problems with point of view at times.)Overall, though, it's far too long for what it is. This volume is about the first sixth of the overall trilogy (it's half of the first book), and it's almost 600 pages long. There really isn't enough here to merit that length. It's dissapointing, because it really had the potential to be much better.",,0

Has this world gone insane? How can anyone make such accusations. War Protestors in America are not responsible for the insane minds who would torture and do terrible things to soldiers. Why don't we blame, oh I don't know, the captors who inflicted these horrors on them? I know its a radical idea to some, but they are the ones who actually imprisoned them and put them in torture.They may have been hurt by the protest in the US, but that doesn't mean its responsible in any way for what they had to endure as POW's.

TONE_POLARITY,"Very true to the original play and without any of the fancy special effects that some directors like to rely on. Excellent actors. The characterization of Ariel was exceptionally good. Costumes tended to be a bit exaggerated, but true to the time period fashions. The director took quite a bit of liberty in the first scene between Stefano, Trinculo, and Caliban, lending it a lot of semi-awkward sexual innuendo that tends to either make the audience laugh their heads off or squirm in their seats. Other than that, there is little to nothing of the play's content that might offend an audience.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The essential truth of this book is that it is a lie. If he lied about things that can be verified, then what else?

TONE_POLARITY,"I really like this and I am not a fan of Rogers. Don't expect great songs here, the title track might be the only real song here and its the weakest on the album - but it is a commerical overture that seems to achieve the goal of leading to the close of the album. Clearly meant to be heard start to finish, I like the trip, and music moves well, the sax and Clapton's sparse guitar rifs fill in the beauty of the picture being painted here. Reading the other reviews I realize the story that plays in my head may not be exactly what its supposed to be! Oh well! I like the roadtrip the album takes me on.",,1

When he suffers a heart attack and mysteriously disappears, Kate is forced to embark on a quest to save the sun and another star. I disliked the book because it did not seem very scientific.

He's a wonderful entertainer and I can't get enough of him. Oh, the DVD; yes! He sings ""Ooh Baby Baby"" like he never sang it before. Fans, this one's a must-have and a keeper and one you will enjoy over and over.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Despite its powerful, playful use of language, ""The God of Small Things"" was a disappointment. After evoking a certain time and place -- Southern India in the 1960's -- throughout the book, Roy crash-lands into the worst conventions of 1990's creative writing programs. Did the world really need another incest story? I certainly didn't.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"When my good headphones got broken, I needed a quick and cheap fix until I could afford some more high quality ones. I'm not a fan of ear buds, but after reading reviews here I decided to pick a pair of these up. I am not disappointed.Despite their size and price tag, these ear buds pack quite a punch. I was downright amazed by the sound quality, which is simply incredible. For under ten dollars, you can't get better sound. Also, the winding case is a very nice touch. I can keep my headphones from getting tangled, and it only takes about five seconds to get them back in the case.My only real gripes are that the cord is only a meter, far too short if you want to have any freedom of movement when listening. Also, they pop out of your ears too easily, especially because they're short. However, such a problem is minor considering the price and quality of these ear buds.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I would definately recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Jerry Lee Lewis fan. Unique camera angles really make you appreciate just how good he is at the piano.

TONE_POLARITY,"The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small. We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute. The outfit was on him, a little snug, but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting (we typically leave a button or two undone or something). This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up. But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and couldn't breathe. I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying. Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin (even through the shirt). I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old!! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"It won't cut square unless you fiddle and fiddle with it. Even once you have it square, the body flexes relative to the base because it was designed so poorly. Also, after not much use the bearings developed runout in them, I can turn on the saw and watch the blade oscillate sideways 1/8 inch. Irritatingly, the fixed portion of the guard goes so far forward and is so far out from the o.d. of the blade that you cannot see the blade begin the cut unless you manouver yourself to the side. This saw is a total piece of garbage, no thought in its design and very poor quality.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"While this book is a fine human interest story it fails in certain historical accounts. The author's insistence that Americans lost the tank battle at Sidi Bou Zid due to the superiority of German tanks is absolutely false.

The kids were fun, as were the characters out at the camp, but Dan and Phoebe were overbearing and irritating and the SKFSA plot device was weak and underused. This book was no where near as good as Dream a Little Dream, Kiss An Angel, and Heaven, Texas.

TONE_POLARITY,"I had these shoes since I was a sophomore (2006-2007) in high school. And I must say, they were worth the money at the time.

With Rain, Enya does what Enya does best - beautiful piano and catchy melodies supported with soaring vocals and strings.

If you know Enya, you'll like this one. And, if you're a new fan, this is a good introduction.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"O.K. love is not the same for all, however, this movie did demonstrate how love is shared for some couples. This film comes off so true for some of my experiences with love. Is this healthy love??? Maybe or maybe not the point is that loved ones that share so many years together is not always the smoothest road. For many it takes strugle and even a little tourment but the point of the movie is to show that even love that does not come easily is still wirth it.. I loved the movie because of how real it was for me. I know it was not that way for all that is just how I felt about it",,1

TONE_POLARITY,From the first page you are sucked into this adventure! When Maddie bursts into John Danhill's room and announces that he better not tell the two men chasing her that she is there. She then goes on to tell him that she got in his room because she told the clerk that she was his wife. From that point on you can't put the book down. It is a book with wonderful characters and good dialog between the characters. Maddie is quite a spitfire and he admires that about her. I also enjoyed the friendship between John and Boone. I would have given this more than 5 stars. It is a keeper on my shelf. I highly recommend it!! You won't be disappointed.,,1

The Waring website says this product is sold with a glass carafe, but they don't sell the glass carafe as a replacement part - only the plastic.If you think you're going to crush ice or use the power of the motor, you're going to have big problems with the plastic carafe.

TONE_POLARITY,"Although I think this book suffers from both an uneasy writing hand and some grim, soldierly editing, it is nonetheless good history. Once you get used to the (odd) style, you can follow an authoritative account of the U.S. Third Army through its training days and then its arrival in the European theatre, with the spectacular results that ensued. It is, as it should be, a rollicking sort of book, that recounts the events in mannish fashion. It's quick and (relatively) easy to read and adds something to our knowledge of this American hero of the Second World War who, had he had his way, might have started a third immediately! Four stars because it's worth reading.",,1

The material seemed very cheap like something that you opholster a cheap car with. It was stretchy and nappy looking up close. I expected more from an Armani.

Forde does a good job of structuring his book to allow entry into the complex and often counter intuitive thinking of the Theology of the Cross.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to gain entry into understanding the concepts of the Theology of the Cross, anyone who wanted a refresher course before diving deeper, or anyone who wanted to use it as a devotional guide.",,1

Amazon will sell me a refurbished original for $99, but no discount on Kindle 2 or the DX. . . . I think hardware should last longer than just about two years, especially given the cost.

Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar.

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this lens because of all of the outstanding reviews it had received. I was thrilled to have a lightweight lens for my Canon 7D as the other lenses I have are quite heavy. Although it had a plastic casing, so many reviewers felt it produced excellent images. I was sold and agreed this was good purchase and, indeed, I liked the images produced with this lens.However, now I have a different perspective about the lens. In the middle of taking a photo about a month after purchase, the front of the lens literally fell to the ground. I could not believe it came apart. This also damaged my Tiffen UV Protector filter. I have contacted the seller and will await the response before commenting about customer service. Perhaps I just received a defective lens and all will be remedied with a replacement. None the less, I wanted to post this review as a indication that perhaps you get what you pay for!",,0

Lehrer does not high brow you, plain simple writing, easy on the reader. He usually has very good historical research interwoven into his novels. You feel good after reading one of his novels.

TONE_POLARITY,This factory refurbished model 360 GPS worked for about ten hours. Initially it worked fine. It then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip. I called tech support for help twice. The service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me. It is a language issue. They suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem. The unit was fifteen days past the 90 day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me $144.00 to examine it. I can't afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service. Stay away from the refurbished unit and don't buy a new unit without an extended warrantee.,,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Memory cards are coming down in price. I sold my 64 MB Olympus card when I got a new camera with video capabilities. This card has so much memory you really need nothing else. It can be used with cameras, camcorders, hand held PC's and some audio players. I don't care about how many minutes of video I can get (it's a lot), but I do care about the number of photos I can store. If you want to take HIGH quality photos, you'll get @ 110 photos; NORMAL quality photos, you can get @ 210; BASIC quality photos will give you @ 560 photos. This is with 6 million pixels (2832 X 2128). At this rate, even BASIC (4 X 6) photos will print well. This is a very competitive price for this card, but I would still shop around.It's also very important to check that this card is compatible with your camera and PC processor. I have no problems, but I've been lucky.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this juicer because it seemed like it had a lot of really good features at a good price, but it turns out that this is nothing like it is promised to be. They promise it will be whisper quiet, but it actually makes quite a bit of noise. It's actually NOT dishwasher safe, a fact I learned after taking it out of the dishwasher and discovering that it was now stained and had rough, peeling edges. The chute is only big enough to feed a whole apple into if that apple is the smallest one ever grown, and the juice spout is so low that you have to use shallow bowls to collect the juice. The kicker is that the plastic screw is extremely flimsy and broke within about a dozen uses. I'm in the market for another juicer, but I won't be getting another Jack LaLanne. This time I'll invest in something like a Breville that will actually WORK and KEEP WORKING.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Bought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the 2nd one. I charged it twice without any problems with myXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitand on the third time I noticed the lights on the charging Kit wouldn't turn on, as in there wasn't any battery in it. Left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as I suspected it didn't charge one bit. I've googled a lot trying to find a solution but haven't found one. What I did find was that other customers have the same charging problem. Very dissapointed.EDIT: Forgot to mention, I also experienced what other reviewers have written. This battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller. I didn't pay much attention to this the two times I used it because I was happy that it was working properly. Have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this product.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Your own agent summed it up best: ""To present yourself as a person who is dying of AIDS in a culture which has lost so many writers and voices of great meaning, to take advantage of that sympathy and empathy, is the most unfortunate part of all of this,"" Mr. Silverberg said. ""A lot of people believed they were supporting not only a good and innovative and adventurous voice, but that we were supporting a person.""No matter what you do from this point forward, no matter how good or not, no one will take you seriously.

TONE_POLARITY,"Once you pop in the invincible cd you hate to take it out. Listening to other albums becomes a sin almost. It is that good. Notice i say good, not ""invincible"". A couple of the songs, namely Break of Dawn and 2000 Watts, just don't fit with the album. However the other 14 tracks more thatn make up for it. The first three tracks just scream to be released to the radio. I don't think that Mike has had a better opening since ""Off the wall"". Throw that in with the mindblowing ""Heaven Can Wait"" and you wonder why Mike just doesnt release the whole album. Maybe the doesnt quite live up to mikes standards, but this is the best r&b album to be released in the last 5 yrs.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"What a rip-off! Discoforme, the maker of this soundtrack and others, makes no effort to bring you the music from this film, it just takes the sound and reproduces it without any refining. A very lazy and negligent method and that gives you a total of only about 10 minutes of music and 35 minutes of yada type talking ON EVERY TRACK. This spoiled it for me, fer sure. If I wanted all that talking, I would have bought the DVD. This is obviously their method/shortcut, as another CD, ""Young Man With a Horn"", bought at the same time, and also by Discoforme, does the exact same thing...spits on the fine music by Max Steiner, and gives you ongoing CHATTER. Both are marked *50th ANNIVERSARY*. Do not buy either CD, and beware of the DISCOFORME trademark.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Democrats hate abortion just as much as anyone else. They just don't think that a woman should be treated as a murderess because she had one. If abortion is murder than any woman who ever had one should be executed. And every boyfriend who paid for one is an accessory to murder. That's the logical outcome of Ponnuru's argument. Democrats want as few abortions as possible, but they don't want to create a new class of criminal. And Terry Schaivo wasn't killed. She was being kept ""alive"" artificially and died of natural causes. Most people would thank her husband for pulling the plug on the grotesque prison of a body that held back her soul.

TONE_POLARITY,"Dr. J's bible study books are written for ""children"" according to the email reply I got back from Turning Point ministries. I would recommend it for children or newbies. What I do not like is that there is no indication of age group. That would be helpful. I also dislike the excessive use of cliche and old standby religious phrasing. I would recommend instead anything by John MacArthur, Norm Geisler or Michael Youseff. The church has become shallow and routine. It's becoming harder to find good Christian teachers.",,0

Will Blade defeat Dracula? Find out in the action packed movie Blade Trinity.If you buy the dvd Blade Trinity there are some spectacular special features including deleted scenes, the unrated edition of Blade Trinity with ten extra minutes of vampires and action and much much more. I give this movie two thumbs up. There is great acting and wonderful use of emotion and violence. I recommend this movie to anyone older than 13 and not to children.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"In June, I attended a David Sedaris reading, part of his latest book tour. At the end, he held up Francine Prose's ""Blue Angel"" and said it was the funniest book he's read in a long time. So, knowing his work, I went into this novel expecting laugh out loud hilariousness. This novel is so much more though. Prose writes with such a clever hand that you don't often laugh out loud, but chuckle inside at her deft use of language and humor and wordplay. I loved the characters, especially Swenson, his wife Sherrie, and of course, the Angela, the Blue Angel herself. If you've ever taken a college creative writing class, you'll appreciate the numerous scenes where student stories are workshopped. Francine Prose captures college life and student attitudes perfectly. This novel made me want to read other Prose books.",,1

It must be silly that someone is trying to give Mr Bean a Hero's role, We should all know that Mr Bean is a perfect loser, all he deserves is always failure. Hollywood is bringing my man down, Help!

TONE_POLARITY,"I think the idea for Littlefingers LeapPad was great...but those ingeneous engineers made one flaw...they need to laminate the books. Or at least put the pages on cardstock! When I bought my daughter the system for Christmas, it came with a book and it was just paper, but I assumed that it was like that because it was the book that came with it. Then, I bought this Songbird book and it was the same way. The pages are easy for my daughter to crinkle and chew through. She's just learning about books and teething...not a good combo.

TONE_POLARITY,"Ayn Rand has to be one of the most verbose yet immature philosophers I've come upon. She seems to fit the classic definition of a psychopath, as her ""philosophy"", objectivism, amounts to little more than a ""do what you feel if it benefits you"" and ""greed is good"" mantra.There is nothing of value in her works if you are one of those people who consider themselves to have morals, even if you're not a religious person.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Stewart O'Nan never fails to impress me. He tackles different themes, different eras, different everything in each book. This one, slim and incisive, is a masterpiece of understatement. The tale of Jacob Hansen's life and losses soon after the Civil War, when the town of Friendship is stricken by both a diphtheria epidemic and a raging forest fire, is exquisitely simple but remarkably powerful. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished reading it. I marvel at how much O'Nan manages to convey without ever being explicit. Love, tragic loss, and survival against all odds are the interwoven strands of the theme. Life lessons compressed into one short book. This is a very special novel, written by a wonderfully gifted writer.",,1

I hope him and Kenny Chesney will take Tim McGraw and all go hang out on Kenny's island so Randy Rogers, Jason Boland, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Wade Bowen and many others will get the respect they so desperately deserve. Trace is nothing but a marketing stunt and I have ZERO respect for all the worthless, mindless EXPLICIT his label has put out in his name. Support live, real music. Not this.

TONE_POLARITY,"Purchased this item for my boat (sea ray 175 sport 3.0L). On initial install the Carb diameter hole was a bit to small so the flame arrestor would not fit onto the Carb flange. This was corrected with a Dremel tool, after a small bit of grinding it slid right into place. The next step was finding a threaded rod log enough so the arrestor could be secured to the carb, after a trip to NAPA (local auto supply store) that issue was also corrected. Finally fired the boat up yesterday on muffs and she purred like a kitten and looks good too. Cant give details on performance yet but I am hoping K&N claims are as accurate as they say. One suggestion I have is, I would like to see an all inclusive kit with everything needed to do the job for your application.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"We purchased this swing since it got such wonderful reviews from so many people. It is an adorable swing with everything a child could wish for. Except mine. He hated being in it. He is six weeks old and loves his bouncer but could not stand being in this swing for more than a couple minutes at a time. The motor is a little loud and he would startle when it was started up. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why he didn't like it, except to say that it does provide a lot of stimulation, so be careful if your child is easily overwhelmed. This review isn't here to bash the swing, just to say that some kids like it very simple and don't require all the gadgets and gizmos. He loves his plain old bouncer. We subsequently purchased a FP open top take-along swing which we've had better success.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Basil Kirchin works with electirc harpsichord, percussion and a few reeds on Abstractions For The Industral North. With such a narrow scope, the music remains spare throughout. This is basically variations on one or two themes.Which does not make it repetative or boring. The melodies are so light and transparent, this album maintains a pastoral feel throughout. Kirchen works enough permutations, both in the writting and arranging, for Abstractions...to hold your attention.Kirchin worked a lot on 1960s soundtracks. I don't think this album is for a particular movie, but it defiantely has the nuance of 60s film music. The electric harpsichord in particular gives the album that post Sgt. Pepper barouqe feel everyone was aiming for.Kirchin should have worked with the Zombies or Left Banke. That would have matched perfectly.But, trust me. This will more than do.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"So if you're a bit like me, you look forward to New Year's Eve and July 4th...not just for all the fun and festivities (and fireworks on July 4th) but also for the Twilight Zone marathon on SciFy. Every year I always catch and episode or two that I've never seen before, and catch a few I know by heart, enjoying every second of it.So during the winter months this year I decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. This is the Ultimate Twilight Zone package for any fan. Plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. Simply put, you can't do better than this. All struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my TV screen.So do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!T",,1

It seems to be mastered from a record-and judging from the nauseating sound of all the side two tracks (6-10), the record used was pressed off-center!!! Artwork bears no resemblance to original, and mine came with a booklet but no tray card! Add to that the fact that 2 tracks are missing from the original release, and this makes the disc useless. Most Dante fans already have a copy of the vinyl, and that is a superior copy to own at this point. Wait for Ron to reissue this himself-he'll do better...",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I've owned the Dewalt since it first came out. So far I haven't had any trouble with it. I cut oak, walnut, etc. without any problems. This isn't a cabinet saw, so don't expect it to cut through thick materials all day. It works fine for about anything else. The miter that came with the saw is pretty cheap, I replaced it with a better one. My only complaint with the saw is that the blade is so close to the front edge that it makes cross-cuts on anything wider than 4 or 5 inches a hassle. It does have the best fence adjustment system that I have ever used. After you have used the Dewalt rack&pinion fence system you won't want to use anything else. My advice...if this is your only saw save your money and buy a bigger more powerful one like the Delta Platinum. If you lack space or need portability, this is a nice saw.",,1

It is supposed to stop if encounters a clog, but occasionally we would find it slipping the pulleys against a clogged rake. Eventually both of them suffered a failure of a gear in the ""transmission"".I don't think this is the worst machine in the world and maybe if you pay enough attention to it, it will last longer. But ours needed to be taken apart too much, the bags and liners are an added cost and for the price it is not worth it. I will not buy any rake style automatic box again.",,0

It started just producing some bubbles that quickly dissipated, leaving the milk as flat as before. Changing batteries doesn't fix it; it appears that it simply doesn't have the RPM it used to have and can't do the job anymore.Having gone back and reading more of the negative reviews, it seems this is a common thing. Some get their Aerolatte in this state from the get-go and for some it works for a while and then slows down like it did for us. It's such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted. If it was half the price, I might consider buying a new one, but at this price it's just not worth it. I will look for an alternative.",,0

An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of ""Feeling Good"" and ""Fool for a Cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""Mexican Divorce"" and ""Jesus on the Main Line"".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song ""If Walls Could Talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. Enjoy!",,1

While I in no way, shape or form agree with Propagandhi's politics, I still think their music is great, which is kind of weird because they're so closely tied together. For me, their views don't diminish the listenability of this album, because it appeals to me as a rock record. Tracks like ""Purina Hall of Fame"" and ""March of the Crabs"" are great pieces of music, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on. So if you by chance are a right-winger and like kickass hardcore with a little melody, download a few of these songs, you might be surprised.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Very affectionate as memoirs go, as the author's appreciation of San Miguel grows with the passage of 15 years. We see nervous visitors develop increasing resourcefulness as they become contented residents, while they introduce us to a parade of beguiling acquaintances. Familiar ground to those who love Mexico already, a worthy introduction for others curious why we do.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Simply: This ""album"" is a waste of time, money, and effort. This is Kiss' worst album, yet. Even ""Music from the Elder"" had redeeming qualities--it has a ""theme"" some ballads, and rhythm. This album ""Carnival"" is trash. I'm embarassed to tell people that I'm a Kiss fan when I listen to this. I would go to the End of the world for Kiss. This album, however, should have been the death of Kiss. Sad. They can't play alternative--there are better bands for that. This album is simply trash.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The cover works great. It gives nice protection to my grill from rain. The material is of high quality. The sandy color looks nice. There are four buckles to tie the cover to the grill so that it will not be blown away by strong wind. The only drawback of the cover is that with the cover on, very strong wind can push the whole grill down. But I guess that is the case for any cover. Just have to find a right place to put my grill so that it will not fall down. Overall, I like the product.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I requested (and received) a pair of these last Christmas in the ""Cognac"" color. Wow.

Makes for a more relaxing flight.The 'gator' finish is a nice distinction, too. Highly recommended. VERY comfy.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT. And I'm not a female by the way.Nice ALbum. If you like Tonis other works,.....GET IT.",,1

However, it is pertinent to mention that the band's latest disc, ""Farmhouse"" is comparable to the Dead's ""American Beauty"" album, in that the songs are short, well consise, beautifully played, and, might I mention, extremely catchy. Hopefully, more music aficionados will catch on to Phish because of this more accessible format. I, myself, am finally starting to appreciate the longer jams, i.e. Tweezer, that have been captured on the band's live CD's (""A Live One"") or on tape.

The only good things about this video were, obviously Tony Levin, but then all of the props Pete was using throughout the concert. The new drummer is the most boring guy to watch since Peter Criss...Although, his old stuff with KISS was fairly exciting...but this guy butchers classic songs. Then theres the fact that Pete also got rid of his old keyboardist - again. Now its a boring woman with no real show of talent. Pete also brought his daughter along, but she can get kind of annoying at times. Overall, if you liked UP, get this DVD; if you prefer classic Pete stuff, avoid this DVD.",,0

I am a fan of the more folksy IG songs and think that ""Let Me Go Easy"" is one of their best as is the live version of ""Gone Again"" available only on iTunes as far as I can tell.

TONE_POLARITY,"I've seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn't believe they worked as easily as they said - WITHOUT STREAKING - until I tried the L'Oreal Towelettes. I've used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it's so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body. The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case. One towelette does indeed cover face, upper body and legs. Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it's easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth. The price isn't bad considering the convenience.",,1

Of course it is not the same colors and all but santana is cherring and has his hand up in the air like that hung cover and there is people in the background. At This point Willam Hung is the more original artist. If that is not a bag on Santana then i do not know what is. The other thing i notice is that clive has people on this cd that have upcoming cds coming out or are on his label. And speaking of american idol why is Bo brice on this that is really lame, he while as well have gotten clay aiken. I cant believe this is the same guy who played with Hendrix, the Who, and joplin at woodstock after hearing this those artist are probaly rolling over in there grave.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"As a person of partly Greek ancestry, and Protestant upbringing, when I contemplated conversion to Roman Catholicism, I asked the priest why I should not become Orthoodox. He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended.",,1

Gram Parsons was dead before I was born, but, thanks to this recording, I've had the opportunity to listen to the golden voice that is still vibrant with life. This is an outstanding country-rock recording, and it's great to have (it bears repeated listenings very well). I would have never have stumbled on it, but my uncle, knowing my musical tastes (which include Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, and Bob Dylan), guessed that I would like it, and he was right.

There has never been a steel building destroyed by fire, including ones where explosions occured.

Look at pictures of other buildiong collapses and you will see they look nothing like what happend at WTC.

Needless to say I didn't like the way it made me sound to other people that I was talking to. Every one commented that I sounded like I was in a tube. The sound quality in the ear piece was fine but, because of the mic being designed into the ear piece with unidirectional pick up it makes you sound bad to every one you are talking to.Bottom line: I sent them back.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This album is a huge departure from The Sea and Cake's previous album, Oui. On Oui, the songs were very warm, the synthesizers were used to support the traditional rock instruments. On One Bedroom, the songs, while still engaging, are more electronic and alien. The guitar steps aside for the synthesizer, and the drum machines seem to appear more than the drum set. The division between songs that center on more traditional rock arrangements and more electronic compositions is actually pretty equal. What's amazing is that the album is cohesive enough to make the instrumental songs flow seamlessly with the heavily electronic songs. Not only do the songs flow well on this album, the cover of David Bowie's ""Sound + Vision"" makes sense next to the original compositions. So, if you're interested in the Chicago music scene, if you like electronic music, or if you're a fan of tasteful light rock, go listen to this album now.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This is definitely a 5 star disc. Mock Orange has been my favorite band since I first heard 9s and 6s for their creativity/originality and musical talent. This album is in every way better than both 9s and 6s and The Record Play, and it is not hard to say that. I would have to give the first two discs 4 stars. Mind is not Brain is by far the most mature and well rounded of the three, their best to date and the best rock out there today. It's just plain cutting edge. The sound is new and original, the songs are more complete and the singing is right on. The Great Mock Orange will finally get the respect they deserve for this masterpiece of music. If there is another band with this sound, I would love to know. It's time for emo to get funky.I am in love with this cd, get it and tell all your friends to get it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,My almost four-year old twin grandchildren also love this CD. The boy especially likes Goldilocks and the Three Bears; the girl likes the songs to make beginning French easily learned.

TONE_POLARITY,I bought this for my wife who was uncomfortable with her pregnancy while sleeping. Once opened it can not be returned but in the box it is folded so it was hard to tell its size. It is huge and she complained about it after trying it for only a few moments. She wanted me to return it but it was opened and I decided not to. She tried it the other night for a full night and was not real happy. On another note her 17yr old cat likes it so if you want a 55 dollar cat pillow it was worth it.,,0

I attached this shade to the side of my aluminum awning that was on the back of my house, because the sun was shinning under the awning during the afternoon and evening hours. This shade looks very nice, and worked exactly like I wanted it to. I can also unhook it from the poles I put up, and let it hang down the side of the awning to block all the sun and keep the rain from getting under the awning when it's raining. I can tell by the way it's made, that it should last a long time. I paid more for this shade than some of the other's on the market, but I'm glad I did. It's top notch.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I found Tangents to be an intriguing and enjoyable journey through the mind of the author. While remaining true to it's name, I think it maintains a consistent underlying hum of fluidity that never drops you in the middle of no where. It's poetic, introspective and often relatable. It's darker tones echo the confusions of today's world while it's lighter side reflects the inner peace of understanding. Reminiscent of a young Kerouac, it's pieces of ordinary life through the eyes of a mind in search of life's truths.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design. I'm glad I got it as a gift, I would have hated to have spent any money on it.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The Taschen Posterbooks are of excellent quality. The six Van Gogh's given us here, for a very low price, are a nicely representative group. Primarily the most impressive factor is the accuracy with which the colors are reproduced. Having seen many in person, I am very critical of prints with poor to pathetic truth in color. We like them to the point of hanging all 6 in our home. The images are of the cafe at Arles-night, lane with cypresses, one of the sunflowers, one self-portrait, the bridge at Langlois and of course, the bedroom at Arles.Regardless the amount of money you have to spend, definitely buy this little jewel as an adjunct.

Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department. The pictures are really elementary in skill level. Story: This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals. I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care. The message also offers no solution to the problem. Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something. Text: Not a rhyming book. Actually, just did not have good flow. I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy.",,0

Not only that, but they add some of the most disgustingly flat clean singing imaginable, and the lyrics are terrible to boot. No thanks.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix. Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear. If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,I can't believe the shitty book that I was forced to try to read for my course. This one gives you a good picture of what's relevant. I'll toss this one in since everyone else has - it has excellent tables. I rate them book as execellent. Don't force yourself to read another book. There's nothing to understand in micro - just memorize it. This book makes it easier. I only wish I had had this as a text for the course!,,1

TONE_POLARITY,Four of my friends and I ordered The Gold Coast Cure on the recommendation of a fifth friend. We couldn't put it down. We call ourselves the Gold Coast Girls! The book explains everything so simply and I have never found an eating/exercise plan so easy to follow. What I noticed first was that the water weight I carry in my hand and feet disappeared. I feel lighter and so much healthier. I retooled my pantry and my entire family jumped on board with me. The changes in our diet were really easy to make because they did not seem drastic. The kids love the soy nuggets. I can't believe such simple changes in my diet made such a difference in how I feel every day. I have so much more energy. It feels good to feel good!,,1
TONE_POLARITY,My nine-year old daughter loved this book. It is one that she enjoyed reading and read through it quickly. It is the one book this summer that grabbed her attention and held it to the end. I highly recommend this book.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Mr Cronenberg a thief? Well, I thought he might have 'borrowed' some ideas from Pasolini's SALO, but it appears they were released around the same time. If anyone's been light with their fingers over this movie then it's George A Romero.Reprehensible use of minors in this picture cannot make this anything other than a one star, but see it for Paul Hampton as doctor Roger St Luc. His performance rocks!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any ABB fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group. The ""early sounds"" are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron. The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock. I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. How is that? Because the Allman Brothers will remain one of the benchmark bands of rock. Favorite songs are Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, and Statesboro Blues. Whether the Brothers wrote it or re-arranged it, the sounds on the Festival album are on any real fan's ""must have"" list. Buy, I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Trust me!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I borrowed all three seasons from a friend so there was no need for me purchase the set, but if you watched the show before you will know that it was a must. This show is not for people looking for low brow jokes though it does provide it, this requires a certain level of sophistication and intelligence to be able to fully get all the jokes. Definitely should still be able to enjoy it though does have its occasional slapstick stuff. Must watch show.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"A Songs Best Friend - John Denver Remembered is a collection of interviews with a lot of people who knew John and some clips of John. This is not a concert by John but a series of people who knew John (his ex wife, manager, etc) There is some of John's music in the background (and 4 of John's songs in another section (Special Effects) but this is mostly people talking about John. I saw this on PBS but at the time they were having pledge breaks. The DVD does not have any pledge breaks or commercels and you can play it whenever you want if you buy it. Even PBS may trim this down to make it fit ther time slot and if they have pledge breaks they may have to trim it more to make room.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I found this movie extremely dull and laughed exactly one time. The ""comedy,"" if you really want to call it that, is beyond juvenile... and not even the funny juvenile humor that makes other movies good. Overused accents are very rarely funny, especially when they're so over accentuated (like in this film) that it gets to be annoying. How so many people liked this movie is beyond me, but it makes me think about how bad society is becoming.",,0

It still sounds like a Staind record, but don't expect the heavy guitars like on Dysfunction. The song writing is very good. Aaron's lyrics are awesome on this album. I think the best songs on the album are ""Price to play"", ""Zoe Jane"" and ""How About You"", but all of the songs are good.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The folks who designed this software should go back to kindergarten. How on earth does anyone make a software that does not install onto a hard drive, is beyond me? Are these guys so paranoid about their intellectual property that they forgot the fundamentals of software deployment? Not everyone likes to carry around a CD with their laptop, once a software is installed. I'm sick and tired of software designers who do not trust that many people who use software actually pay for it and buy it. Josh Waitzkin should reasses his association with UBISOft. In their brilliant attempt to thwart piracy, they have created a totally useless piece of software, especially for the 21st century.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I am shocked there are not more books about the personal life of this interesting person in history. This book gives a very good picture of Philip II and the forces that shaped him and the religion that governed every aspect of his life, loves and holy causes. Because of his long reign, and dealings with all the important persons of the 16th century, his personal attitudes shaped so much by his childhood, influenced the political, social and religious tide of that time.

TONE_POLARITY,"Steve Porcella and Cameron Burns spent at least two summers collecting information from historical figures while putting up newroutes to all fifteen of the >14K foot peaks in California. This book is chockfull of history gathered directly from some of the earlyclimbers of these Sierra peaks. Many of the approaches to these peaks are arrived at by hiking (which is half the fun when in theSierras). As both authors are world class climbers and besides supplying detailed maps and routes traced onto photos of the peaks,they have included many B&W photos of such points of interest as approach scenery, actual routes, historical contributors, as wellas many photos of themselves climbing the routes. Thoroughly enjoyable, this book is as interesting for the armchair climber asfor individuals wishing to expand their climbing horizons by exploring these magnificent mountains in California.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm not sure where to begin with this weird movie.I was just curious to see how weird it really was,and dang I found out that it's pretty freaking weird.The story is about how Satan sends his demon to earth,to try and turn all the children against Santa Claus.The film has very bad acting,with unknown actors and actresses.You can tell they dubbed the dialouge in English,so it was probally made in another country.Mexico,I think.It's just a bad Christmas film,and it would be very disturbing to kids.It's just very strange.Although there are some funny moments.Especially when Satan tells the demon that he'll be punished by being forced to eat ice cream if he fails in his mission lol But overall,the movie is really bad....unless you wanna have a good laugh or two.If you want a REALLY good laugh,pick up SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS instead,and leave this one alone.",,0

At first I thought it would be your typical ""chick"" type book... but it was not at all!!! At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams. The NYC references were so fun to read, having lived in NYC myself. The story itself holds a great, positive message, and an interesting twist at the end. I REALLY HOPE to see this come out in a movie! I highly recommend this book!!!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I didn't care for this story at all. The story moved very slowly and the characters were very shallow. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, and was sorely disappointed when the predictable end came. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that Salvatore introduced a Dwarf cleric and I was impressed with this new character. Drizz't fans all over will be disappointed.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This book can enter into the hardest of hearts with its pictures. Its simple message shows what the results are of holding a grudge.I have used it within a prison and it was able to provoke good discussion. An adult book disguised as a children's book.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"As the 2nd book of a series it is as good a read as the first. It continues where the first book ends and takes you on a wild ride that will have you staying up late to find out what happens next. I read the entire book in 2 days. I was captivated and totally enjoyed the story line and plot. You don't have to read the book series in order, but it sure helps. This book stands on it's own merits as quite a good read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of the Nephilim. If you have never heard of the Nephilim, then you NEED to read this book !",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Although I liked what I see regarding the whole set, I would prefer this outdoor item in teak for durability, weatherwise.

TONE_POLARITY,"Sergio Mendez has been with me since the mid 60's, when he started adding that Samba beat to regular 60's tunes-The Look of Love, Fool on the Hill, and i believe his own, Mas Que Nada. But i never knew that he had a purely instrumental album out there, and with Antonia Carlos Jobim to boot. This was part of the Exotic culture that your grandparents were into in the early 60's. My favorite track has to be the Girl From Impanema, practically a standard in the early to mid 60's. This is nice as background music for a quiet dinner party, or if you're just sitting back and reading from your Kindle that you got from Amazon. The liner notes indicate that there was more material that came from this meeting, but was unfortunately destroyed in a NJ warehouse fire in '78, where Atlantic had all their demos and sessions work stored.

My doctor said I couldn't exercise at all but after a week of that my muscles (and my brain) got very twitchy and restless. Now I've started to do this yoga DVD again and it's gentle enough to ease my restlessness and doesn't cause any contractions. I think it's saving my sanity and keeping my baby healthy to boot!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It's been a long wait, but it's been worth it. There hasn't been a really good literal tranlation on a character by character basis for a very long time, and not only does this book give us that at long last, but it also gives us an excellent English translation that captures the spirit and meaning of this most enigmatic of scriptures as well as the best out there. As the author says, this is only one possible translation, but then he procedes to give us the complete text in Chinese with all the varied possible English equivalents so we can proceed to make our own translation or come to terms with the full depth and range of meaning as never before.The lengthy chapter disecting the meaning and possible translations of the first verse, the kernal of the entire work, is worth the price of the whole volume.

I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade.

TONE_POLARITY,"except maybe Jeanette Winterson's ""Written on the Body."" I felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me. I consider it my rebound (without the consequences). Please read this book.",,1

A brewing book based on the original ""Clone Brews"" book, should have gone beyond the great simplicity of the first.Isn't that the goal of every follow up?

To say that this book is a ""must own"" for the brewers' library, and compare it to books like ""Beer Captured""; is a misrepresentation of a incomplete work--that only seasoned brewers can decipher.

The outside handles are extremely comfortable elastic and the weights, in my view, are not unduly wide (but I have average to large sized hands).I would, however, caution anyone planning on using these for kick boxing. The bean-bag style of these makes them very comfortable for this, but because the length is quite long, as you punch, they're going to shake a little. This will give you the feeling of some sort of a connection or oomph at the end of your punch, but you may find that you feel like you're waving a shaking instrument around or something.Still recommended for kick boxing, but just contemplate whether this is a sensation you're going to like.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"The Carolina Cottage Folding rocker came today and what a let down. The wood on the arm was cracked in several places, from green wood being used. It is also sloppy feeling when sitting in it. The chair sent to me is not worth $20. Don't let the Caroline name fool you. It is made in China and is as cheap as a Chinese Christmas toy. I called the company directly to complain and put in a return for a refund with Amazon. I should have known it was junk since there were not any reviews. Hope this helps anyone else in the market for a folding rocker.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"In my opinion, a so-so effort. Well produced, but I don't think the material. or arrangements, are particulary well suited to Diana's strengths.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"The book is a wonderful series of concise well-stated points to puncture the ""liberal clown ballons"" wherever I meet them in life. The world is becoming a dangerous place with socialism the great destroyer of nations.The only criticism I have is that the key points were repeated several times as if the master tutor does not want you to forget that liberalism is discredited and of no use --- period.P.S.Liberals -- yo mama didn't raise you right and that is yo problem as they say it in New Orleans",,1
TONE_POLARITY,The book was very descriptive and hard to put down. Theefforts made by the family to stick together pulls on the strings ofyour heart. I would recommend it to people of all ages.,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This is pretty good keyboard, for the price, especially becuase it has two USB ports. I have an ibook, which only comes with two USB ports of its own, so having the extra two is very nice. It was pretty easy to set up too, just plug it in and your Mac pretty much does the rest. The only problem I have with this is the depth of the keys. If you are used to typing on a laptop that has shallow key depths, it takes a little time to get used to this keyboard. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but it does slow down my typing. But then again, I probably would have had the same problem with any other keyboards.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,.....If you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the Abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the Civil War. Raymond Masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical John Brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......The movie also pairs Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss DeHavilland as the love interest of both Flynn and Ronald Reagan with Flynn emerging victorious......Altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"You know, even the people who claim to hate this movie are writing about it. That alone says something about the movie. If they really hated it, why are they writing? I have seen better movies in my time, and I'm only 12 years old. And yes, in case you're wondering, I'm a girl. But I'm most certainly not one of those Leo-infatuated blockheads.He's not as bad as some people say, though he could use a haircut, and a few more muscles. I admit that the reason that this movie is PG-13 rated seems a little inappropriate for a 1912 setting, but it's a love story, and how many people who are still alive were old enough in 1912 to remember what it was like then?Please don't let the bad reviews phase you. It's good, not great, but it's still a movie everyone should see. I've seen Star Wars: Episode I, and it's a lot better than Titanic. But Titanic is still good.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"My daughters were running to the mailbox every day to see if this DVD had arrived, and once we received it we were not disappointed! The interactive format is fun for those who haven't ever tried yoga as well as kids who are a little more experienced. My girls especially loved seeing other children practice the poses. The benefits of this great new DVD are that children of all ages learn how to do different yoga poses in a safe, easy format that's a ton of fun! I wholeheartedly recommend ""Animal Yoga for Kids"" and we're anxiously awaiting the next one!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"There is a lesson here that movie producers should heed; the availability of exceptional talent and technical craftsmanship is not a sufficiently good reason to make a film. This grim piece of cinema is a perfect testament to the fact that even an unapologetically offensive script about the absolute worst dregs of society can be turned into an award winning movie. I am quite sure that someone won a bet over whether style could overcome the lack of humanity in the end product. This is not entertainment, it is an assault on goodwill and common sense.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,My 9 year old daughter received the laser tag game for her Birthday. She and my 5 year old enjoy it so much that I have to take it away from them almost everyday so that they will do their homework.We are shopping around to purchase another set for Christmas and are having trouble finding it.What I like most is that they have to move around and get the exercise that children don't get just sitting playing video games.We live in Boston and it is cold here now but that doesn't stop them from asking to go outside everyday to play laser tag!I want to buy the extra set so that their friends can play too. (I don't mind playing either)I bet it will be fantastic to play in the summer months late at night!kpj,,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Anyone who has wondered about the secrets of youth should do well by reading this book and focusing on a new reality inside the human body: the power of our vital glands. In the East, these are called ""chakras"" and they are thought to be energy-producing and energy-absorbing centers. The story, the exercises, the advice, and the claims posted by many people on the strength of tangible results, should not be overlooked. Simplicity here, is the key to an awesome power which lies within ourselves.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Well, first, this thing is REALLY loud. I know by virtue of what this is that it is noisy but I usually grind at night which defeats the purpose, so as not to wake up a sleeping hubby. Second, it is a giant pain to get the coffee out of the thing without getting the spoon caught on the blade at the bottom. The turn to clean thing works ok but there are so many steps to get it off the base and the top always flies open and flings coffee everywhere. I do think it works well, you can grind for the right number of cups to get the perfect grind and it has a buil in timer but I will definately replace it with something different when I buy the next one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I have never in my life read such claptrap. Heaven as Disneyland is such an utterly ignorant concept I'm at a total loss. That people read this book and are uplifted actually scares me. It's McReligion made real. I suggest books like ""The Tao Te Ching"" or ""The Prophet"" or even ""Conversations With God"" for a more fulfilling and reality based journey into spirituality. However, if what you're aiming for is a few hours of reality-avoidance and want heaven to be something like 1950's America, then maybe this book is the one for you.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Watched with some friends and we all agreed that especially for a sequel, the movie was very good in keeping with the flavor of the original.What so commonly happens is that multi sequels just keep adding more and more action,usually going way over the top.However MBI3 had the action and added heart !",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I finally stopped reading this book. I could not stay awake for more than a couple of pages per night. It dragged on and on and I did not find any of the characters very appealing. I really wanted to read it because I had little knowledge of this period in history, but I will have to find another book, because this one just didn't do it for me.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I actually received *two* bags in my package! I think they've changed the fabric: the tag inside mine says ""100% polyester"" - I don't think that's the same as rip-stop nylon. The bag feels like it's made of heavy plastic. Maybe they have started using cheaper fabric, and doubled how many bags you get?I agree with the other reviewers about the convenience of this tote. As long as you pay attention when you first unpack it, it's pretty easy to stash back in the bag.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I lived in Rio de Janeiro for some 5 years, teaching and coaching in both English and Portuguese .. this book was my suggested ""primer"" before arriving for the first time to understand the wild ""religion"" known as ""Umbanda"" or ""Macumba"" ... I saw most of the ceremonies noted in this book ""first hand"" in my 5 some years in Rio .. often at knifepoint .. often as the only ""white guy"" in the crowd ... it is stunningly realistic ... but returning to Rio many years later, these ""practices"" are all but disappearing .. anyways .. for me ... it is a ""travel back in time"" to when on Sunday when the 99% of the population would visit a Catholic Church, and then light their ""Macumba Candles"" on the way out ... ""just in case!"" Easy reading ... highly recommended if you have any interest in developing Brazilian society!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Anne Stuart is usually a dab hand at romance writing, but here she (unusually) fails to transcend her maudlin genre. Oh dear, the old hackneyed memory-loss plot device. And am I really expected to believe that two supposedly non-stupid people madly in love with each other completely mis-read the other even through marriage? The heroine's character undergoes drastic change when she loses her memory (even though the book itself admits that amnesia does not bring on personality change) which is never satisfactorily explained. The plot is not only predictable, it is too incredible to work for me. Sure, romance is never realistic (by definition; life is not romantic) - but good romantic writing should bear at least a passing resemblance to reality.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This DVD is an excellent adaptation of Sayers' book! Practically every twist, turn, and detail of the book is skillfully incorporated. Often characters are speaking Sayers' exact lines. The views of the fine old church add what a book cannot give. The actual sound of the bells also, though not very musical, add a valuable dimension.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Wilcox brings a grace and beauty to what could be a dry, technical subject. This is not a 'how to' book, though anyone familiar with the bookbinder's craft will gain insight into specific procedures. Rather, it is the exploration of why we love books, love those who love books, and love the preservation of an ancient craft, as it is handed from master to student. As her understanding of her craft grows and deepens through her relationship with Anthony, Wilcox shows us her heart and gives us a glimpse into the soul of this master binder. While the subject is bookbinding, the real story is that of passion for a craft, for the unique combination of intellectual, aesthetic, and physical skills that go into any fine craft. To share that passion with another, as Bill Anthony did in his teaching, and as Wilcox does in her book, is a very great gift, indeed.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"For much of this book, Cahill seems to have merely paraphrased most of the Hebrew scriptures. If a reader already has a working knowledge of this text, they may find this book boring and not very informative. Since I came to this book with a good understanding of the Hebrew Bible, I was very disappointed. Perhaps a reader who is not familiar with the Hebrew text would find the large middle section informative and interesting. As for me, it was merely annoying, because I keep waiting for new information or a new insight.However, his commentary of the development of the beginning of Western thought was interesting. It was an angle that I did not consider before. We are so used to Western Civilization being around, that we forget that the thought had to develop at some point. To trace that development was interesting... but I just wish that that tracing did not have to include the paraphrase of much of the Hebrew Bible.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"To put it as simply as possible, Sphere is one of those books that once you pick up, you won't put it down. Chricton's style of writing leaves the reader constantly wanting to ""see what happens next."" He entices us with incredibly vivid imagery. Chricton is like the rider of a mule, who is hanging a carrot out in front of the mule. The reader is the mule, always pushing forward. Excellent book.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"How desperate are we to be included with others who think this book is some sort of revelation?While I'll admit it's a mildly interesting read, let's get real...this book does nothing more than take the basic principle of cause-and-effect and try to elevate it to folklore status.It's also riddled with half-truths and skewed conclusions -- some even nonsensical. Take the author's slam on Sesame Street vs. Blue's Clues for example. He notes that kids scored better on problem-solving after some watched Blue's Clues and and some watched Sesame Street.No kidding?? Really?? Could that be because problem solving is the sole focus of Blue's Clues?? Have the kids recite the alphabet or test their grammer skills afterward. Hmmm....Basic cause-and-effect....nothing more. C'mon people -- think for yourselves!",,0

When the box set finally came I took one dvd out to see it had minor scratches, ignoring this I put the dvd in the player only for it to tell me it was unable to read the disc. I tried the other ones only to find out that they won't play either. Now Im pissed because I really like this show and bought it to watch but it is obvious that HBO doesn't give a F about The Wire or you because they would have put these dvd's in a normal dvd case instead of a piece of construction paper.",,0

These werent big drops, 3 feet max. It has reading problems where for no reason it would say ""read error"" (this happens even before you ""break"" it). It was great having 180 songs on one CD, but replacing it so often is not worth it. I reccomend the sony line of CD players (they have a mp-cd player too), that line can really take a beating.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"The handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something I look for when poring boiling water. Also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.The color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect.

TONE_POLARITY,"I picked this up as a used book, so my edition is older than most, but I have to agree with some other reviewers here who questioned why it was brought back into print. Clearly this novel is a low point in Benford's career. I really wanted to enjoy this book but I couldn't get past the filler. All the ""intrigue"" and running around by our heroes got on my nerves and did little for me in the entertainment department, in fact it prevented me from finishing the book. I simply didn't care about these characters enough to follow all their exploits and ""sneaking"" around in order to wrest the artifact from the clutches of whats-his-face (Kontos). I have read a great deal regarding ""alternate theories"" about the origins of man, so I was looking forward to reading a novelized version of those theories from a trusted author like Benford. Things just didn't work out that way. Try Timescape or Heart of the Comet for a MUCH better representation of Benford's talent.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Being a legend of 1,086 pages, the Lord of the Rings is truly the only book one can read and feel like you've stepped off a train which has transported you from Tolkiens' world and back into yours. It is by far the longest book I have ever had the amazing pleasure and honor to read. I highly suggest you take part in Frodo's adventure with his faithly servant, Samwise, in a overly valiant effort to overthrow the dark lord, Sauron. It is a tale of triumph and defeat; of death and glory; and of sadness and great joy. If you do not read this book, you will be doing yourself a great injustice.",,1

It keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. This movie has such a sad and wonderful story about Jamil. All the things he went through.

TONE_POLARITY,"Here's a hint, Jackie: Get Funny! Who wants a ridiculous collection of unfunny material? Maybe Jackie's relatives-- certainly not Stern fans, who appreciate a good laugh. Buying this hunk-o-poop CD will give people dry heaves-- unless they've eaten! Then real chunks will spew. Martling was very, very high when he recorded and edited this collection of bad jokes, and it shows. He REALLY wants your 13 bucks: if you pity him enough to pay him, go right ahead. This reviewer is of the opinion that Jackie should concentrate all his energy on his Boff Stern, who is the only reason he is A)Kinda Famous and b)Not Poor. Do your job, Jack. Keep the jokes on the Stern show, and don't worry about CDs like this one, which is a much better coaster than anything else.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have thoroughly enjoyed other books written by Jude Deveraux, but Wild Orchids was truly a disappointment.

TONE_POLARITY,"When I originally bought this CD back in 95, I found myself just playing the hits (Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Morning Glory, and Champagne Supernova), and skiping over the songs I didn't know. Maybe I just didn't have much time, and decided to only listen to the songs I KNEW I liked. I really don't remember.But I finally gave this CD a real listen a few months ago, and damn, it is good. This is sing-a-long, feel good rock and roll, with an old time British Rock sound....but harder. ""Hello"" is great way to open the CD, and I love the way ""Some Might Say"" begins. Great Guitars! My favorite songs on the album are probably ""Some Might Say"" and ""Morning Glory"", but I pretty much think whatever song I'm listening to at the time is my favorite! I could probably do without ""Cast No Shadow"" and ""She's Electric"", but overall, this is a solid CD.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"AMAZING - Thrawn is back! When I first picked up this book I could hardley put it down. Zahn writes in a style matched by no one. The story is that it turns out the Bothans were the ones responsible for helping Palpatine destroying a long lost world. The news comes out and everyone wants to either kill the Bothans or save them. Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself. Zahn includes all the classic charactars whom other authors have seem to forgotten - Mara Jade, the Noghri, Pallaeon. On top of this he mixes Stakpoles Rougue Squadron and Booster Terrik. All in all this action packed novel has you eating out of it's hand. Buy it at all costs. Oh yeah, Just try working out who or what the Hand of Thrawn actually is - when you do read the next book you'll be in for quite a suprise.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this series with high hopes and I found viewing it to be very disappointing. The host was annoying the images added nothing to the presentation and there was way too much time spent looking at peacocks and flowing streams.I suppose that the history would have been OK if it weren't so scanty. This was very much a quick overview, which often left out key facts that would be vital to understanding the motivation for actions in later parts of the series.I commend the idea behind creating a good series in the history of Britain, but I can only suggest that this one be avoided at all costs.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This almost does what I want it too. I bought this as a replacement for a GPS V - a very good GPS mapping system in its own right. I require a larger memory capacity, and a larger screen, so I got it here. The color screen is much easier to read. The 128 MB card and USB programmer are wonderful, and provide me with a set of maps for nearly all of my trips without having to hook up the unit to the computer for an hour or more for a half day's worth of maps.It has a couple of flaws, the mount isn't perfect, so if the car vibrates, then the GPS does too. The GPS V, didn't have this problem, it was rock solid. Nor can I alter the fields that are displayed in map navigation mode - the GPS V would allow me to change the fields, so I had miles to go until the destination - now I have to switch to the directions page for that.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do.,,0

It's also usual that a sequel will just recap everything from the first book in a rush of summary that leaves the reader's head spinning. Here, everything is gradual and well-explained, and old characters are not thrown at you as if you know them. It's ... fresh, young, and moves fast enough to keep the reader wanting more.All around, there are few books I have enjoyed as sincerely or thoroughly as this one.",,1

Surprisingly powerful--it seems to cut with the same ease as a gas powered one the same size. If you have a small lawn, this is all you need.

I'm fairly new to the Anime scene, really only familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's features (the Disney of Japan, search for ""ayao Miyazaki""in VHS).

Similarly, my OS class never really got into MP subjects like memory ordering and the effect of caches on the OS. But this book brought everything into focus with clear explanations and good examples.The best way to describe this book is that it's part computer architecture book and part operating systems book. The operation of the hardware is presented in good detail, without going as far as worrying about gates and transistors.

Christopher's why of thinking - and consequently, his actions - make logical sense, but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't.This is a book that I highly recommend to everybody - it is not only an interesting read, but also a great learning experience.

TONE_POLARITY,"Set-up was a breeze. It does take some time to key in all your components, but once you're done, it's easy as can be. Doesn't take a tech genius to do this. Would have gone for the 890, but cost is so much more for IR feature and backlight. Remote is comfortable, and rechargeable batteries are a definite plus. Logitech has every one of my devices, even for my A/V switch which caused me some concerns, but Logitech had it. Much better than I hoped. Wife loved the simplicity of the remote. One-button push much easier to turn on devices. I currently have 9 programs for this remote. Absolutely love this remote. Can't live without it now.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Like most of the other 1-stars here, this review is for Amazon's terrible packing and the apparent flimsiness of the product. Unfortunately, I never received an unbroken skillet. On the bright side, 5 stars for Amazon's excellent handling of returns.I ordered the skillet and received it via 2nd day UPS with a 2-inch crack down the side. I returned it and received its replacement via next-day FedEx with the handle broken clean off. Aren't these things supposed to last decades? At this point, Amazon seems to want to cut its losses and refund my purchase price.ATTN: Amazon-- Maybe it's cheaper to spring for better packing materials than having to pay for return shipping and trashing tons of these skillets?Based on this product's noted propensity to break either during shipping or during use-- and in light of its notably skinny handle-- you may want to spring for thicker, slightly more expensive cast-iron cookware.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I just finished watching this and came away thinking this was one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!Without going into the storyline...the film has a lot of subtitles since it is mostly Chinese speaking. But this only gives you an appreciation for the frustration of the lover who knows little chinese, and of his being part of a charade to fool your lovers aging and ill parents [which includes watching him kiss and marry someone else!]This film brings up all kinds of issues, such as gay acceptance, is lying ever good?, personal responsibility, growing up, abortion, respect, committment....And the wonderful thing is, it doesn't try to answer any of these. You come away sorta happy, kinda sympathetic for everyone, and rather sad that, in the year 2004, going to these sorts of lengths to hide who you really are is not so uncommon in real life!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I love this show but I am returning this box set and decided to order the individual seasons separately for the following reasons:1) Many of the DVDs are faulty and skip even when they are not physically scratched. I tested this with multiple DVD players which have never given me problems before. If you check other reviews this quality control issue is pretty common with the DVDs from this box set. From what I can tell the quality control on the original season sets is much better.2) Disc 28 was missing and I got two copies of Disc 29 instead.3) The corner of the collector's box was broken/damaged when i received it.4) The discs are spread out through 6 scratch-prone cardboard-like sleeves for each character instead of by Season. Cute, but i don't want to have to open up a damn episode guide and look up the episode number to figure out which season i'm about to watch, while worrying about scratching my DVDs when taking them in and out of the sleeves.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought 3 of these alarms for my familys house. Only 1 functions as it is supposed to.2 of these detectors give off frequent false alarms. I had to take them down because they kept going off for absolutely no reason (all too often while my family and I were asleep!). This is not due to any error on my part. No remote control issues, no dirty sensors, etc. I carefully read the manual and looked at posts on this site and others made by users of this item to attempt to troubleshoot the false alarms. No solutions worked.As someone who works in the field of quality control, I find a 2 out of 3 unit failure is extremely pitiful and for a company that manufactures products that people depend on for their personal safety, well, that's absolutely disgusting. I'd give this item 0 stars if I could.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I loved Katie's dragon series so I decided I'll try this and see how she does with vampires. I loved the title thinking that maybe it might be about a vampire falling in love with a human. Boy, was I wrong. It was about two girls going to some place in europe and consulted their friend who was a witch to see if they would meet their perfect match. It started off real good with a little emotion here and there. I was bugged by the fact that was the main hero a vampire or not? As it said 'A girl's guide to vampires' I assumed he was. No, it turns out the guy she didn't love was a vampire or so called 'dark one'. The main character fell in love with a normal guy. This was a very disappointing book to me. The main character was a little annoying but she didn't bother me while her friend did. If you like contemporay romance with a little supernatural twists then this is for you. Romantic paranormal fans will be disappointed.",,0

It is so horrible I thought it might damage my screen or projector and took it off. You get what you pay for, if you need to split your HDMI signal you are going to have to buy a powered splitter.

TONE_POLARITY,"The cover which shows Tunstall playing electric guitar leads one to think that the recording features some hot guitar. Unfortunately, it doesn't. In fact, even on the up beat opening track, there is no instrument break--a typical Tunstall song--unrealized potential. So, we now know that Tunstall can prance around and strum guitar but she can't PLAY guitar. However, all of the songs on the CD are decent if not exciting. It's disappointing that not more was done with them.At 39 minutes of music, this is not a generous offering and shows that Tunstall isn't a prolific songwriter. She has a fantastic voice and should have filled out the CD with cover songs. Also she needs a producer who has great musical ideas and can realize them with supporting musicians, lead guitar riffs and other rock 'n' roll ideas.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!",,1

I couldn't do it so I bought this 18 volt cordless model. it has considerably less power than the 12 volt, which had a battery about twice the size of the 18.volt. I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model.

The theatrical and extended versions could easily fit on a blu-ray disc. That is the point of blu-ray!!!!! More space on the disc = more video!!! If they had released the extended versions, I would have bought them and a blu-ray player on day one. In addition, I might have bought more New Line films on blu-ray by now too.

I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"An intriguing look at the beauty that was Hawaii's first capitol, Lahaina. Personally, this book evoked memories buried deep in my heart. The collection of photos and the author's eloquent writing combine to create a book of high caliber. It is evident that Ms. Kupau is quite knowledgeable of Lahaina's history. This volume of the ""small town series"" allowed me to relive the vivid images of Lahaina that was my youth. Sigh. I remember my old friend Edith Miyahira and her two daughters Jean & Jane who operated the jewel of the Front Street restaurants at the time, Seaside. The home made saimin, fried rice, shrimp curry, hamburger steak and potato salad were among my favorites. Just thinking about the food makes my mouth water.

But as time has passed, other artists have written better lyrics and music about personal issues though I give it to janet for starting the trend with dance divas getting personal too in their music. The music on this CD is really really good, but as a whole album it's hard to listen to now because though I always thought this CD was the most timeless janet CD out of them all and a good blend of old school and contemporary r&b/pop though several tracks are beginning to sound dated, it's still worth a listen.",,1

The bonus for me was the discovery that it also does an amazing job with soft- medium- or hard-cooked eggs.

There are only two pieces in addition to the dolls and their hats, and they are nothing more than kids meals toys.

If he eliminates 90% of disease in his patient cohort, he will most definitely win the Nobel Prize in Medicine. It's nice to see that magic elixir salesman can still fool the medically disenfranchised.The one thing that he hasn't talked about is the horrible ionizing electron radiation from the space aliens that live on the moon.

The only favorable point I can possibly give it is that the producers did not shy away from using an actress who, thankfully, is not trying to hide her age and is accepting the cycle of life with a grace that makes her even lovelier.",,0

Philcox takes the artists' own explanations of their techniques and adds some of her own helpful comments and observations.

Tyler whose realistic and brushy artwork steals the show.,,1

Mr. A. Kutcher is STILL pretty much playing Kelso (""That 70s Show"") and never for a second did I believe him as a pro killer. Ms. Kat H shows just how limited her acting range is. The action scenes are nothing special and the dialogue is fairly lame. I KNOW it's a 'popcorn movie' and not meant to be taken (too) seriously, but JEEEZ, I think I actually laughed maybe ONCE. If you've NEVER seen ""Get Smart"" (the TV show, not the movie), ""Hart To Hart,"" or Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" or ANY 'James Bond' movies, you MIGHT like ""Killers.""

No tattoos, ear-rings or other piercings to smother the Y gene.

TONE_POLARITY,"Mr. Moore writes about the issues with the Bush family and the ethics of the US government towards the World before and after 9/11. Most of his points are backed up with research; some points seemed bias especially concerning corporations and the government. I do agree with most of his points although would recommend readers to do their own research beforehand. I thought this book deserved 4-stars, since Mr. Moore kept pushing the same point towards the Bush family and thought he should have expanded more on the other government officials he mentioned in the book.On a side note, I just saw his movie ""Roger & me"", which depicts the Flint city falling apart due to GM leaving the city; this movie also shows how Mr. Moore started his journey. It is good for the American society to see a different point of view from the ones we see on public TV and some newspapers. Looking forward to watch his newest movie ""Fahrenheit 911"".

His notion that emotional infidelity is more dangerous than a sexual affair because everyone wants emotional attachments, is more a scare tactic rather than good advice.If you look at his rules, then anyone who has an emotional attachment outside of marriage is guilty of infidelity. Best-friends, close siblings, parents, children from a previous marriage, could all fall into these rules. You could have an emotional affair with your mother or your best friend.Instead of focusing on real issues that cause ""jealousy"" Neuman blatantly says that we should avoid and be on guard for those people who might even want a friendship.This whole concept is wrong.There are better books and better sources to read",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Gilberto Gil has been making music since the mid '60s. I like to think of him as the Brazilian Paul McCartney: a master melodist, warm singer, and committed pop conceptualist. His influence over today's music has been subtle, but it's hard to imagine Arto Lindsay, Carlinhos Brown or Tortoise without Gil. His last album, ""Quanta,"" was good but maybe a little too slick. ""O Sol De Oslo"" is his most natural-sounding, relaxed record in years. Texturally Trilok Gurtu's percussion adds that certain element of mysticism that has been present in Gil's work from the beginning. In fact Gil is one of the few pop artists who can combine that ineffable feeling of joy with a finely honed formal beauty. ""O Sol"" is immensely enjoyable; it's too bad earlier albums like ""Realce"" (1978) and ""Refazenda"" (1975) aren't more readily available in the United States, not to mention his groundbreaking ""tropicalist"" work from the swinging sixties.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,First of all one great show that has been lost in this hype is Fraiser. Kelsey Grammar has been playing his character for 20 years and no one gives him credit.

I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her. Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived. Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those ""clairvoyant"" elements.3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting. For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian.5.)

TONE_POLARITY,"Well, we put the elliptical together, that was not bad. Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Mr. Streissguth's work is a welcomed effort to begin someone on the path to understanding Dr. Franklin. Though brief, Mr. Streissguth includes many salient points often left out of simple biographies. Points include the difficulties he faced in politics, the failures he knew, the mistakes made. Although written for the young reader, he writes with thoughtfulness and respect. The book never has the ""baby-talk"" voice found in some young reader books.This biography allows the reader to understand Dr. Franklin was a real person living in difficult times.

TONE_POLARITY,"The greatest thing about this product is that it is a mobile library. Most people don't have a plethora of space to store their books. This device could revolutionize the future of reading.The downsides are that it is extremely expensive and then it costs additional money to add books (about $10 or less a book). Secondly, there are only so many books you can get and most of them are more current and mainstream. If you are a fan of books that are older and maybe less popular, you're out of luck. While the demand remains for this product however, the list of books will grow.In short, I would only recommend this product for people that can't keep books with them for space or because they travel a lot. If you already have a large book collection, I wouldn't go getting rid of it for this product. Besides, what if your power goes out for a week and you can't charge it?

TONE_POLARITY,"As much as I love Nora Roberts, I can't give this re-release of PLAYING THE ODDS and TEMPTING FATE five stars. Why? For starters, as much as I wanted to I just couldn't get past the ""time warp"" problem. There is no way that couples who met, fell in love, and married during the 80s can have adult children in the 90s. I haven't read Daniel's story yet, but I'm sure I'll find it even weirder that by the time of THE MACGREGOR BRIDES, he's 91! Secondly, Caine's constant lighting up of cigarettes drove me crazy. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't French kiss anyone who smokes as much as he did in his story. Yuck! And lastly, if an author is going to write a family saga, she should remember what she's written in previous books. In Laura's story in BRIDES, Roberts alludes to Caine finally convincing Diana to take that walk down the aisle. Wrong! In Caine's story, Diana proposes marriage to Caine. Despite all that, the romances are wonderful. Roberts is one of the best.",,1

There are times when I am running that I can hear parts of the music that I don't necessarily hear using my Bose at home in my living room. It provides excellent reproduction of the full range of sound.2. They don't fall out of your ears. Not once.3. You can wear a hat because the band goes around the back of your head, under the normal area for your hat.4. Another reviewer mentioned wind noise but I don't find this to be any different than my old ear buds.5.

You turn it on, it blows air. It doesn't seem to blow air any further than any other fan I've had. It works fine in my average-sized bedroom. It is pretty quiet and is small, two features I like.

Why?The Skagen is thin and light and I have gotten several unsolicited comments about its attractiveness. I was surprised to see that the numerals are raised and lined in silver, not outlined in white as it seems from the photo.The calendar will be too small for people with bad eyes, the band is a bit complicated to do and undo (it becomes easier with practice) and you have to use a screwdriver to change the size of the band.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"After reading many of the reviews and researching every P & S in the compact digital camera class for over 2 months, I decided to go with the SD850. I bought it to replace my PowerShot A400, which takes great pics but is really slow. I couldn't wait to try out my new cam and did so after a full battery charge. Well, I'm sorry to report that this camera, for the amount I paid, does not live up to its reputation. Low light pics are the noisiest I've ever seen and being I will be taking most of my pics at gigs and concerts, this camera will not do it for me. I tried every setting including all manual settings but who wants to fiddle around with manual controls if you're trying to capture a candid shot? If you are considering this cam for purchase, please note that it is a very poor low light performer and if you will be shooting in low light, you should probably keep on looking. I gave it 2 stars because I like the LCD display. Happy Holidays!",,0

I didn't want to pay full price for another official guitar after having already spent so much to get the game with my first guitar, so I went with this and I am satisfied with my purchase. It has allowed me to play with two people and I have not had any problems with it. If you and all your friends are hardcore guitar hero players, then go for the official, but if you are a casual gamer or don't play on expert, this is a great way to allow two people to play without spending too much extra money.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this toy for my youngest grandchild for Christmas (I'm guessing at the ratings, since she hasn't received it yet). I started to put it together, but I didn't get very far: the parts were so ill-fitting that I didn't have the physical strength to do it. I got my son to help me, and it was a real struggle for him to get it together, even though he is strong and very handy. At one point we thought we'd have to send it back because we couldn't get a rod fastened from one end to the other. Now it's together (although I'm concerned that it won't be sturdy, given the barely connecting parts), and it's nothing like the racer pictured. It's blue with yellow and red, instead of all red, it doesn't have decals, and the shape is different. The box says ""Push & Ride Racer,"" but in fact the toy looks just like the Little Tikes Push & Ride Doll Walker also sold on Amazon. That's not what I wanted: I wanted the toy in the picture.",,0

The good thing about it is that you can read them story by story and put the book down not wondering what in the world happens next.

I even passed my turn in line for a bathroom stall because the floor looked damp. In other words, more cautious than one should have to be with shoes. With all that care, after four wearings, the bottom of one shoe is beginning to wear through the little woven straps of ultra soft leather. If these shoes had the sole of a shoe rather than a slipper, they would be my favorite pair of shoes. Now that they're falling apart, I can't wear them (looks tacky).

His trumpet playing is rather weak and cannot be heard in any abundance throughout any of the tracks. He plays a variation of an old song, Consuelo's Love Theme, but apparently drags it out to fill up space on the CD. The album is appropriate to help a listener fall asleep or in a depressive episode.

It's about the relationship that develops between a sheltered, over-religionized teenager, Ben who goes to work for over-medicated, hyper-eccentric washed-up actress Evie.The whole plot is predictable. It's obvious from the start that Ben's home life is tottering from the weight of over-religion. You see that coming form the first few scenes and can predict almost how it will end up and it ends up like you imagine. Evie's neediness borders on paralysis and it's painful to watch. Julie Walters plays a good turn as Evie but with a lack of charismatic acting by fellow lead Rupert Grint, it falls on Julie Walters and she just couldn't carry the movie alone.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I have never written a review before on any produst that I brought on amazon. But this video was so much garbage that I fely obligated to say something. First I love the history channel and therefore expected a lot from their video. However all it talked about was american cars and the evolution af indy cars and Nascar. There are rally cars, touring cars, endurance racing all different types of racing all over the world. In fact racing probably did'nt even start first in the USA. I learned nothing new nor could I interest my young nephew in it. I also got the motorcycle video and it was just as bad. Advice to History channel.......there is another world out there!!!!!",,0
TONE_POLARITY,This dvd looked like a bootleg copy ten times removed. I could barely make out the facial features or still items like flowers on a table.

It was called, The Old World Restaurant. On the corner of Sunset and Horn, right across the street from the original Spago. We alway said hello to one another and had idle chit-chat. He was very pleasant and was always alone. I remember what a big star he was in the previous decade and wondered what had happened to his success.

Recently, other movies have come on the list and Sixth Sense is no longer on it.

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this CD after hearing classic Dead songs, such as Uncle John's Band and Friend of the Devil. This sounded NOTHING like those songs. It starts out innocently enough; Good Lovin' is a decent upbeat track. With the exception of Fire on the Mountain, it goes downhill from there. The vocals become invading and annoying, switching lead vocals often (who the heck is that chick on from the heart of me??). At times this record is too easy listening, at other times it's too arena rock. It finishes with the weak ""If I had my love to give"", which sounds like a B-side Paul McCartney top 40 ballad. Leave this album on the shelf, or better yet, don't buy it at all!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Just as Rankin & Bass had tackled Tolkien before Jackson did, they also did a King Kong movie. Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out.",,1

Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I rented this hoping for a fast, furious adventure flick. Instead I found this movie pretty much bored me: especially the first 20-30 minutes. The story? A washed out ex-fighter and his mage wife discover a cursed mountain is really the home of an ancient dragon. Can he and a band of 4 other adventurers find a mystic orb which will save the realm?I like cheesy movies, but D&D; 2 was pretty much as bad as it gets. With the exception of the actor who played Nim (the Rogue), most of the acting was of the quality produced by first year drama majors reading lines from a script. The settings were drab (mostly browns and tan), and the spectacular D&D; universe reduced to a bunch of cheesy CGI special effects.My advice: save your money and rent. 1 star",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"These things look really slick and create very nice looking ice cubes. But as far as practicality goes - they're a total strikeout.- As the other poster said, there's no easy way to remove the ice cubes. As these trays are soft rubber, a flexible seal is created around each cube and flexing the tray doesn't eject them. You pretty much have to push each cube out through the back.- The top of the tray and cube walls are all the same height, this means filling all the pockets and loading the trays into the fridge without spilling is a challenge.- The trays are a non-slip surface, which means sliding them into the fridge also is annoying.Yes, these are all nit-picky points, but when it comes to something as simple and utilitarian as an ice cube tray, when someone gets it wrong, it's that much more noticeable.",,0

But as far as diapers go these are my favorite ones. They are absorbent and fit snugly on both of my children.

TONE_POLARITY,"I saw the pretty good reviews of this book and expected a lot, consequently I kept reading expecting it to pick up, but it just didn't. Nick was basically a jerk; he (and this is a bad thing) seemed like an unnecessary character. He didn't have much depth and was annoying as was Pru whose shyness didn't disolve until about page 330. I couldn't take anymore blushing or stamering. The entire novel lacked quality dialogue/conversations. Finally, there seemed to be no basis for Pru's love for Nick and when he started to love her I just didn't understand how they could love each other and didn't believe it was possible in the way the novel was written.

Half the time the characters don't even look human - nor anotomicly proportioned nor drawn with any consistancy.There is no interest in any more volumes, overpriced for the thin book that showed up, and I'd advise others to spend your money on something that is a better value and is a better product.",,0

Earlier in the school year, we read Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh, which was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much since I had read it many times in kindergarten and first grade. The book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like Jane Leslie Conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. The book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. The plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, I didn't like it. It was also too long for such a dull book. Usually I would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. However, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better.

I called the customer service number and they are going to send me a new one, but I am not so sure that I want it now b/c I read a similar review. This item needs to be recalled.

I really like the pictures. Obviously, some images are not great - especially the ones my four-year-old took when he ran off with one of the cameras. Got some great shots of the kids swimming, people sitting at the edge of the water, etc. It was nice not to worry about ruining my phone or a regular digital camera trying to use it near the sand and water.

TONE_POLARITY,"Let me say first up, if you're looking for a professional pen set, look somewhere else. That aside, this is a pretty good amateur set.This pen set comes with 8 assorted pens, as advertised. One is a ""thin"" felt tip (thicker then most ball tip pens), a medium felt tip pen, and 6 marker tip pens, which are only different from each other thanks to the ink tone, which ranges from light gray to pure India Ink black.If you're not used to drawing with pens, this is a great set to start out with. Practice a bit, and you'll be making some fine art in no time. If you're more on the experienced side, well, you don't really need ME to tell you what to do.Haven't been able to tell if they're refillable or not. The back end rotates, but I'm too scared of making a huge mess to try to pull it off. Guess I'll find out when the ink runs out in one of them, but this is a great value either way.",,1

I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets, each packet yield 2 cups soup, so it produces 8 cups soup for just about $5 with great miso taste. Even Amazon cannot beat that deal.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"The character is a lame fellow who decides to marry a woman he dislikes because he fells in love with her sister. All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion have not disappointed me. Well, I guess there is always an exception to a rule.",,0

A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, ""completely photochemical"" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same. Regardless, this Blu-ray format presentation of The Big Country is a pleasure to view and I will not fault this Technirama gem-of-a-film. The transfer is very good.

TONE_POLARITY,"Hey, like most of you, I think that Lila is also sooo underrated, it's not fair because she is really good. She has an outstanding voice not like most other country singers. I personally know because I have a karaoke system in my house and I pop in CD's every once in a while to sing to when I'm bored. Now, I think I have fairly an average voice and man, I can't pull off the songs as good as Lila can on this CD, while I think I'm better than Shania Twain when I sing her songs, because I guess they don't require that much vocal talent and does not have a lot of difficulty. Man, I got to give it up for Lila for doing so great on all the songs. So yeah, this is a great album with a great variety of songs, from the upbeat dances and ballads, to the inbetweens--it just has it all. Want to find some more underrated artists? Check out Hoku and Jennifer Love Hewitt.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,I have very rarely given this bad of a review. I normally give at least 3 stars just for writing. I was shocked ms. Delinsky put this dribble out. She has written some fine books this is not one. The use of the F word and sex was just gross. The fact that a best friend could have sex with her best friends husband and by the end they are all friends again. Then the story goes on that the injured wife can understand why the husband had sex with her friend and neighbor. Come on what world does that happen in? I finished this book because it was on CD and I had a long drive otherwise I would have thrown it across the room. Why anyone gave this book 5 stars is beyond me. If you want to read trash this is perfect.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This video is much more like a dance class than a workout. And the instructor doesn't really give much detail on how to do the steps...she just starts doing them. There's a warm up segment, a ""workout"", and then a cool down (three separate segments on the disc, with pauses). In the ""workout"", there are a lot of stops and starts...much like learning a dance in a dance class. It doesn't flow at all for a workout. And there are times when the cast messes up and they all sit there and laugh. I thought that was interuptive and very unprofessional. This might be an okay choice if you want to learn a few little mamba and salsa moves (they are all mixed together, so it's not good for learning a particular style of dance), but don't buy it if you're looking for a workout video.",,0

On the second run through the house, we never needed to empty it a single time. Talk about suction!! Even our high traffic areas are fluffy again!Better yet, it was easier to push than my old vacuum. The center of gravity on the Dyson is lower than your average upright, so it's not constantly tipping over the way my old one did. The extra long cord allowed me to reach the entire house from one central outlet. Assembly was quick and easy, and I LOVE that most of the tubing is removable and washable. Way to go Dyson!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"From the book...--""Come back to bed,"" he added. ""I lied before. I want your mouth too.""I'd forgotten how devastating I found that little phrase. I want. Well, it was more than a phrase, after all -- it was, as I could have told you at nine years old, a complete sentence, the verb sweetly agreeing with the subject in number. Number? One. Just him, his declarative, subjective singularity -- taut, swollen, urgent. I want. Tense: the present. Oh, yes, very tense, and very present. A simple sentence, wanting to grow, to complexify, its predicate demanding its object --- give it its object. Your mouth. And I opened my mouth, and he pulled my head down on him, hard. Oh, and I want you. I want you. To want it. To want me. It. Dissolve. Drown in the ambiguity.--Stunningly written, this little bit of cunning linguistics alone is worth a five-star review. It literally took my breath away.Thank you, Molly!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Gosh I was disappointed by this book. The characters were two-dimensional and unconvincing, there was the suggestion of an interesting subplot involving disgruntled locals with a grudge, of which we heard nothing more, ditto the hinted at marital infidelities and the background to Stella's flit from london to the countryside. The first-person narration was plodding and dull - Stella's observations were pedestrian and her problems (sunburn, hunger, an insalubrious suitor) uninteresting. I've seen lots of glowing reviews of this book on amazon and honestly can't see why. Avoid at all costs, life is too short for dross like this",,0
TONE_POLARITY,I bought this 720 to replace a 720 that kept falling off the dash board of my truck. The last fall broke the plug where the power cord connects. I love the 720 and was lost without it so I bought a new one. The only problem I have is the suction cup on the mount. It seems like it only lasts for about a year. Of course I leave it in the car with the unit attached all of the time and I have a disc on the dash which the mount connects to. I did have an issue with the maps when I first hooked the unit to my PC. I made the seller aware of the issue and they stayed in touch until the problem was resolved. TomTom actually resolved the issue for me with very little trouble. I actually think my issue was my fault due to already having a 720 set up on my PC. But within a week or two I had my 720 up and running with no further issues. I would recommend the 720 to anyone.,,1

With the new prequels, a new breed of genius has taken the visual cues from Episode 1 and have developed an evolving world that leads into the dismal grey world of the original trilogy. Lead Art Director Doug Chiang, Ian McCaig, Jay Shuster, Ed Natividad, Ryan Church, Eric Tiemens and others bring together visual assault and appropriate culture cues to develop a wide array of designs and illustrations for Episode 2. If you are an artist, or are interested in the production level of film artistry, then this is a must have book.

I came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise.

Also buttons are to small you try to stop and it skips tracks and the accesorries are waay to expensive its [$] dollars for only a 32Mb memory backpack and [$] for a faceplate.",,1

After listening to this album countless times, I came to the conclusion that this is the sort of music that I might think that pirates would listen to. The music is brimming with emotional drivel that makes me quite sea sick. It's time for this fatuous foursome of the seven seas to try something new in life like treasure hunting or shoe shining, but not making another appearance to the studio but to produce nothing but balderdash.",,0

That being said the first 12 episodes of this series are just a very poor rehashing of what was significantly more episodes in the original anime.

I can't imagine what kind of woman would enjoy and give a good review to a book where the heroine was raped. And, yes, it was rape no matter what flowery term you put it in. Neither the ""hero"" in the book is unlikable and selfish. And later in the book, you find the heroine's first husband, who happens to be the brother of the hero, turns out to have had an affair with a girl while the heroine was waiting for him to return to her in France. There is not a redeemable character in this entire book. This book is a disgrace to women and not worth the paper it's written on.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Sophomore novels rarely surpass that debut novel in quality, but Notaro throws that assumption completely out of her way with this second collection of essays. It's even more enjoyable than her first book,The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club: True Tales from a Magnificent and Clumsy Life. Be prepared to read it and laugh - some of the essays actually caused tears of laughter to roll down my face. It's a really fun read. Yes, Sedaris continues to reign as the Master of the Essay, but Notaro's essays here are so much more enjoyable and a lot less grotesque than those in her first collection. I definitely plan on keeping an eye out for her other books!Of all the essays in the book, though, ""The Craft Toothbrush"" particularly stands out. Just thinking of it now STILL makes me laugh.

The characters in this book seem disengaged from their own problems.

The book's too short; the author doesn't finish telling her story. (What happened to the good old days of long, luxuriant reads?) Maybe my problem is I'm not black, fat, or abused.

How often do you just mumble it in church, waiting for the service to be over so you can get on with your day?Art Simon contends that the Lord's Prayer gives us instructions for more than just a prayer - it gives us instructions for living. And in a clear voice, and an easy-to-read style, he maps out the meaning behind the words.I gave 20 copies of this book to friends and family this Christmas. It was the most meaningful gift I could imagine. It has already opened up dialog about religion and faith with two of those people who refused to discuss their beliefs with me before.But best of all, through this book, I have learned new things about God in my life.

TONE_POLARITY,"As Satanism used to be a parody of christianity, drawing power from it's host and also setting itself up as its rival, so is neo-satanism to satanism. All this book does is use ""Satanism"" as an attention grabber and then twists it to become a psychology lesson on introspection.

I've bought many parts for my old Sierra in particular. I always check Amazon first since at least 8 times out of 10, I find what I'm looking for and either at the best price or an acceptable price.

Finally, about the last 1/3 of the book took off and kept me page turning.I love the serial aspect of these novels, they flow nicely from one book to the next. I also like Flynn's mixture of actual history with his fictional world.So, far of the 4 books, the 1st and 2nd have been the best for action, the 3rd and 4th were much more focused on Washington DC rather than ""front line"" action.Appropriateness: This book contains a fair amount of language... a word or two every 10 pages.

TONE_POLARITY,"The music is way too ""synthy"" for me. In many cases the ""band"" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo.

TONE_POLARITY,"I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This story of a poor British girl with limited means and a big imagination is one of my favorite movies, and always leaves a smile on my face (and maybe a few tears in my eyes, too.).

Not exactly what they advertise for this everything tool. I did try the tool on other materials and found it could only do a good job on drywall (a little more messy than a key hole saw).

TONE_POLARITY,"This is the absolute worst mathematics book that I have ever attempted to use. I would rather stick my head in a vise than try to learn anything from this book. Here are the four of the worst offenses:1. The book is not self-contained. One must constantly refer to other books to work the exercises. Write a complete book next time, jerk.2. If ""mathy"" were a word, it would describe this book. Where are the applications? You won't find anything practical here. Boring!3. How about some examples? That would be nice. Unfortunately, examples are few and far between. Think water in the desert.4. How about some organization? Nope, you won't find it in this book. It will lope along for several sections, then ""Boom! Here are some random exercises. Good luck! I hope you've understood everything perfectly until now, cause this is comprehensive, baby!""This book is required for my class or otherwise I would throw it into a cesspool.

TONE_POLARITY,"Invited by Julian Cope to play his ""Cornucopea Festival"", Manuel Gottsching recruited former Ash Ra Tempel member Klaus Schulze to join him. Third founding member Hartmt Enke opted not to participate, so the 2 old friends played together alone. ""Gin Rose"" is a 69 minute track, constanly evolving. Themes heard on ""Reunion"" pop up here and there, but as a whole this album struck me as more low key. As with the ""Reunion"" album, this sounds like what you would expect if you crossed late 90's Klaus Schulze with Manuel Gottsching. Reccomended.",,1

It's not like he is sick or anything, it's just the normal on this kind of dogs. I read this oil could help diminish the hair loss, but I don't think it does that.

It was a rehash of her old TV shows. I thought I was going to see something new but no such luck. Nothing updated in the whole book. Wish there would have been newer examples I hadn't seen before.

I was never to have to page through two huge book trying to find artwork, I would only need to type in key words and the options would be on my screen. Well guess what, it didn't work. What is even worse, the new book that replaces the old two books, has tiny thumbnails of all the art, it's really disgusting to look for something. To top it off, I got my set of DVDs and I got two #3's and no #4. It was a hassle to get them to say they'd send me out the #4 DVD. I should have received it by now.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is one of my favorite tv movies of the seventies which is about racism in the south. The performances of the two lead actors are excellent. Patty Duke won a richly deserved Emmy Award for her role showing that her Oscar for the 'Miracle Worker' was not just a fluke. Al Freeman Jr. should of have won as well but that's Hollywood.

TONE_POLARITY,"I have rarely found so much nonsense compressed between the covers of a book. This a collection of unwarranted, groundless assertions, irresponsible generalizations and shameless one-upmanship. The success of the book in the 60's is proof of the intellectual despair that marked that decade, attempting to get out of the Vietnam Tragedy throug false gurus and other unsubstantiated claims to objectivity. The few pearls are buried under such a mountain of bull that it is not worth the effor to search for them. Mr. McLuhan pretends to know about everything, and shows he knows absout nothing, with the possible exception of English literature. And even there, his judgments are rarely valid and most of the time intellectually irresponsible. This is not a serious book. Future generations will look at it and judge our enthusiasm for it as proof of our immaturity. I gave it one star because I could not give it zero.",,0

Now i think she went and slutted up her appearance as much as possible to sell cds. The photo of her on her solo cd looks like the coverbox of a porno movie. I don't think any of the hits off her new cd are remarkable at all. If the songs Crazy In Love and Baby Boy are supposedly the best songs on the cd then that's not saying much. Once again we have another example of an artist who used to be good as part of a group who went solo and came up with a big disappointment. Skip this one.,,0
TONE_POLARITY,"1st things 1st. This has the emotional appeal of a paperweight sitting on my desk .. none at all. Contrived, but maybe he'll kill himself lik Ian did, it would be the end of a oh so tragic 15 minutes of faim.But let's move on people. The grunge sceen has been repeting itself with Pearljamisc repetity, so why not goth? At least it's not another winy band sounding like Default, or .. fill in the blank. So in that light it's listenable.Some bands do a good job of covering a style. Let's look at The Merry Thoughts. They sounded a hell of a lot like the Sisters, but were able to inject their own style to give it originality.Maybe, in a few years, She wants revenge will find the dark soul they are striving for.

Right when you think you're on the right trail, she throws in another twist. Anyone who loves a great mystery will love this book. It's a tale about family secrets, the effects of a legalistic, religeous upbringing and how God can work through the misguided mistakes of family. It's about love, lost love and love rekindled. Linda shows us--without being preachy--the difference of being religeous and having the love of God in our hearts, where we learn to love others. Her characters are real and well developed, as is the plot.

This truly is a great collection of some of the best hits The Charlie Daniels Band released over the years. A must-have for any serious music collector",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Well, I'm glad someone beat me to the obvious punchline - that the only torment this book has to offer is for the reader. I checked this out from my local library, thank God, as opposed to wasting my money on it. Let's break down everything that's wrong with this book: zero character development. Writing, laughably bad. Art, to be honest, is pretty horrible -- yeah, I know McFarlane's supposed to be la artist supremo numero uno, or something, but his Lizard looks like a toad, all of his regular humans (especially Mary Jane) look more like cereal box mascots than real people, and his rendition of Spidey, at least in my opinion, is just average. Above all else, I get the idea that McFarlane just really doesn't like Spider-Man as a character. Skip it -- get some of Straczynski's brilliant run on the book. Don't waste your time with this faux-Gothic nonsense.",,0

This book is filled with beautiful pictures the 2 best looking to me were on pages 14 and 84. This book tells about her,how hard she worked and about the sacrifices she had to make in her own life.

A novel of frightening and important ideas and issues: extreme overpopulation, megacorps, and hyperflu wars. The future of humanity hangs in the balance. Who will determine how the scales tilt? The characters are not sharply defined, but the novel is more about the vision than about the people.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"This riveting account of life-and-death drama under the seas competes with any fictional submarine tale. The hopeless state of the Soviet navy recounted in such detail in this book makes the tragic sinking of the Kursk much easier to understand. Hostile Waters gives an incredible inside look at a Band-Aid navy that still suffers from mishap and disaster. The heroism of the crew constrasts sharply with the unfeeling disregard of the Soviet high command for the well-being of the sailors. For engrossing reading, this book stands at the top.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Maybe this just isn't the best introduction to McEwan...I just could NOT get into this book. Everyone I know has read and loved it, but I got the the third break in the writing, closed it, and had NO desire to pick it up again (so I haven't).My main question is: Isn't it a good idea to introduce the PLOT within a few chapters??? There's just a lot of detail for detail's sake...the first three chapters could have been summed up in about a sentance or two...maybe, ""He is an excellent doctor, and not the type you'd want programming the music at your parties"" would have sufficed?Maybe this one gets better...it's a shame that the opening bored me so much that I'll never find out.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Product arrived on time and in good order. The functions are in different order than they were on the older Casio it is replacing. While it has a count down timer, it would be nice if that could be made to be continuous as opposed to restarting it each time. If it was continuous it would be helpful for making rounds by reminding you each time the rounds were to be started. It does lose 3 or 4 seconds every month or so. Also found it interesting that you should not push the buttons when it is in the water, probably has something to do with sealing out the water. The display appears slightly larger than the older Casio even though they are the same physical size, so easier to read and helps when I am running.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"It was an okay movie, but I don't think I would want to watch it over and over again. Obsessed with writing a report on sexual fantasies, decent and charming writer, Mark Demetrius, (played beautifully by Vincent Spano) goes about it the sexy way--by doing phone interviews with ladies with erotic stories to tell. His obsession goes from the office to real life and before he knows it, he is entangled in a web of lies, sex, and murder! The plot is fast-paced with one enchanted bad event leading on to a sizzling worse event. And when you think things couldn't get any more twisted, the conclusion blows up in your face.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,The only complaint I have with the brushes is that they don't always prevent moisture from seeping into the screw-on assembly part of the brush. That results in mildew and goop building up in the base of the brush assembly even after rinsing.

TONE_POLARITY,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it will never match my favorite of his 'The Island of Doctor Moreau.'

I tried all sorts of other training methods (other than shocks) that didn't work. This collar stops him at one bark, if that. The downside: the collars just don't last, not even a year. If Premier would put a warranty on this item, they would find that they needed to invest a little in the quality of the product. They simply stop spraying after a while, even with a brand new battery and a refill. Normally I would not continue to buy an item with such low quality, but I'm addicted to a nice quiet house now, so I keep coming back. Expect about a 9-month product life, and that's if you NEVER forget and leave the unit on overnight!",,0

Half the book deals with various sorts of funky moving averages... not interesting, and not very useful. Also, the readability is extremely poor.

Unfortunately ""We Free Again"" and everything else I've heard from Groundation just does not live up to the hype you'll see here in these reviews. Seriously, even John Brown's Body is better.

TONE_POLARITY,"While this unit was not at the top of Cook's list, it was recommended. There are three significant problems - the first I think is fatal. You can hardly hear the alarm go off. The second problem is to time something for 45 minutes you need to hit the minute button 45 times! The third problem is the battery life is quite short only about one month. Given the price of this unit it is not worth the money and at any price they could have done a much better design job. I am also quite surprised at Cook's rating.

In the fullness of time, I have no doubt that history will not kindly judge authors of Adams' genre. Ethnography, race and culturality are fraught subjects and just as the prevalent works of the late 19th century describe Africans as ""unreliable and savage beasts undeserving of their upright posture..... prone to unreasonable rages.....etc etc etc "", so Adams' curious conclusions will outrage.

THeir lyrics were better, the attitude somewhat different, the musicianship also better and harder. Of course they profited over the whole MTV videos vibe of the time, but that was a natural course to follow, unfortunately.STAY HUNGRY is one hell of a strong album.

TONE_POLARITY,"SimTower first. It's an okay game, where you try and build a gigantic office tower where you can include shops, hotel rooms, and restaurants in your quest to reach Tower status (100 floors, and around 15,000 office workers). The game is fun at first, though as you move along, it gets harder to manage elevators, keep everybody happy, and still make it to Tower status (without cheat codes, that is.) Rating: 3 stars.SimIsle: I can't say much about this. That's because I never have figured out how it's supposed to be played. The help files don't help, and there's no step-by-step tutorial. Unlike other Sim games, you don't appear to be in control of much. Rating: 0.Overall: If you really want SimTower, get the SimMania pack, because at least you get 6 games (SimCity original, SimTower, SimIsle, SimSafari, Streets of SimCity, and SimCopter. SimIsle and Streets aren't worth it, but the other 4 are). Otherwise, don't buy this 2-pack.",,0

Usher should slap hisself for saying yes to the song. Note to R Kelly:Stop making songs with stupid induendos. It was tight at first but its stupid now. make a better cd next time.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"On some of the reviews I have read on Freeway 2, some of the people do not see the connection with the first movie Freeway. I have seen both movies and like them both. Freeway is a modern and twisted version of the Little Red Riding Hood story. Freeway 2 is a very twisted version of the Hansel and Gretel story. That is the connection and why they both carry the same name even though the sequel doesn't have the same characters and a plot involving a freeway.

I have trimmed out houses, cabinets, and various small projects with no problems at all. The quick release jamming mechanism is a great idea, but I've only had to use it once since I've had the nailer(this thing just won't jam up). It has good power but won't send the nail spiraling through the wood. Of course the swivel exhaust port comes in handy just remember to use it. The imprint the nailer leaves on the wood is virtually none except for the nail entry hole, much better than other finish nailers that I've seen. So to make a long story short if you want a good nailer buy Bostitch or Craftsman, but if you want a great nailer buy the Paslode.",,1

I am not often disapointed by expanded universe novels and own nearly all of them, however; this novel was a supreme disapointment. Poorly written and horrendously paced, the author showed no grasp of any of his characters (especially Obi Wan's), with many of the characters displaying the same attributes as the others.

And of course the living kill of the remaining living humans with no guilt or further thought! Reminds me of ""the Dawn of the Dead"" when a scientist teaches a zombie to behave. I found Flynn and his lunatic opposite both due a double tap to the brain. Just dumb. Oh and the sceanery of an island off Delaware doesn't have mountains in the background...

Most of the blame is placed upon the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Director George Tenet; however, some blame is also placed on President George Bush.

Elva was in the movie for no more than a total of 5 minutes. Then why is she on the cover? Hey, sex sells. Slap a hot girl on the cover of anything and it'll sell.

I was really looking forward to a delicious climax. But less than half way through the book, we get lost. Instead, the players who seemed to offer the possibility of such rich texture muddle about as charicatures of themselves, or of players we've seen before in Bonfire or in other moral panderings. Even the names of the characters are there to beat you over the head with Wolfe's point: the sniveling sycophant named Peepgas (honest, I'm not making this up), or the successful black lawyer, Roger White, who is challenged by his ""blacker than thou"" friend, the Mayor of Atlanta. Ultimately, the ending is beyond disappointment. My advice: read the first 1/2, then put it down and imagine your own ending.

So it's natural that he was attracted to the story of Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning, the serially married onetime polygamous wife of Brigham Young, and that he tended to play up the same kinds of things that he emphasized in his more obviously fictional books.At least Ann Eliza comes across, in Wallace's recounting, as somewhat less perfect (and just a bit more believably real) than she does in her own exposé/memoirs, which were based upon her profitable run as a somewhat titillating paid lecturer in Victorian America.Incidentally, the book was never ""banned"" in the Mormon Church, contrary to the deliciously sinister folklore passed on by the previous reviewer.

This is the first product I bought from Sentai Filmworks, and I will say, I am severely angry how they portrayed this awesome anime.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this movie because I remembered how funny it was when it was shown many years ago.

I love the Grateful Dead but Phish might not be a better singing group then Grateful Dead but soon they will be bigger then woodstock! LONG LIVE PHISH!!!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I liked this book a lot. It was boring at first, but it got better. Hearing about the Titanic from a survivor would be really rare. There are funny parts, sad parts, twists and turns, and a little romance thrown in for edge-of-your-seat reading before the Titanic sinks. Margaret is a fourteen-year-old from England who is going to join her brother in America. She lived at an orphanage for girls run by nuns, and is chosen by Sister Catherine as a companion for Mrs. Carstairs and her dog. It is very exciting, especially the parts about the Titanic just before it sank. A wonderful book!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I am searching for something positive to say about this camera, but I am at a loss for words. Negative things, however, are no problem. In short, the shutter lag is ridiculously long, the picture quality is only fair, the 4mb card only holds 6 pictures at the highest quality, the memory card is almost impossible to remove without strong fingernails or plyers, and the software is inferior to adobe. A friend has a kodak DC215 and it is a much better camera than this one. I returned mine and am going to buy the fuji finepix1400 or the kodak. Consumer reports didn't have much good to say about the poloroid, but liked the fuji and kodak. I must say I totally agree with them.",,0

Anyway, I picked up a copy of this CD as a goof only to realize that this CD has some catchy (though rather amateurish) songs but better yet, it sounds great! When's the last time recorded guitars sounded like this? Basically, this is way more than teen pop.

TONE_POLARITY,"I'm a die hard Alan Rickman fan, BUT this movie is extremely disturbing to watch. I won't deny that the acting is good, considering the storyline. But it is VERY hard to watch.

In fact, one review sums up my feelings exactly - ""When it finally did get going, toward the end, I kept looking at the number of pages left, wondering how it was possible that I was almost finished when there was obviously so much story unresolved."" I thought for sure there was a 'To be continued' in my near future. I was shocked when the answers were supposedly crammed into a few short pages. Did Ms. Cornwell run up against a deadline?

Parents hire Paula to coax their adult children into leaving home and getting a place of their own. Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her.

TONE_POLARITY,"Joyce Carol Oates is a novelist of the first order. Her novel of postwar Detroit (really of postwar America), Them, is her best. Nothing she has written, before or since (even including her newest, the fictionalized biography of Marilyn Monroe) brings the reader the emotional power, or the superb prose of Oates' immortal classic. Readers who read Them when it was first published years ago deserve to study the new Modern Library edition. Readers unfamiliar with the best of Oates should run, not walk, to their bookstores or their personal computers and order this classic. It is as simple as that. Them is a masterpiece.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased this machine for our new office because it offered a two-line phone, fax and 8 voice mailboxes. It was the only system I found that had more than three or four mailboxes. The problems we have with the machine are buzzing on the outgoing message, poor sound quality, flimsy fax film that split the first week we used it, and now the additional cordless phone that came with it stopped working. We tried a different (new) phone and that won't work either. The machine clicks when the cordless goes on, but we can't get a dial tone. Sharp said we were past warranty (90 days, I think) so we're out of luck. I sure wouldn't spend money to fix this terrible machine.",,0

Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read.",,0

It's THAT good. That landmark piece and other tasty goodies have been collected into McClanahan's MY VITA, with Ed providing some new bridging material describing his growth as a writer.

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a libretto by an experienced writer of comic opera with a score by a uniquely talented 12 year old. Let us not compare it with what what the mature Mozart could do with the stimulus of an outstanding writer like DaPonte.Still as a traditional romantic farce, when well sung, it can be quite enjoyable. This production is typical of the Mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. I did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. No fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.Clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment. If one is selecting but one DVD to buy, the reader will have to make his/her own predilections in making a choice. Happily more than one approach is available.",,1

Being a messiah is about being countercultural and addressing the injustices in the world. This book drove me up a wall and it nearly went out the window many times.

I liked the extra features. The overall feel wasn't bad either, not as good quality as the techics but not a horrible feeling turntable by any rate. After 2 years one of them is starting to die. When I push the start button the platter doesn't ""catch"" and I have to give it a manual push to ""lock"" it on to the motor.I'm now looking for a second hand pair of Technics like I should have from the begining and saved myself some money, time, and effort.

Even now that my son is on a pretty set schedule, this timer is helpful. When he starts to fuss, I can glance at the timer and see if he is actually hungry or if he's just being fussy and needs some extra TLC.This was particularly helpful to me since my son had trouble gaining weight at first and needed to be fed at least every two hours, per the doctor's orders.

No, you can't.Doing a search on the hp web site, I noticed that the cartridges used on officejet 5610, hp 27, 22, and 56, were listed in the will-work-beyond-expiry list on the official web site itself. But unfortunately it will not on an officejet 5610.Printing a few pages on this unit so far, I have spent almost USD 40 on replacing the cartridge. You bet hp will sell the unit for only USD 100. They expect you to spend much more on the cartridge. So, my next printer will not be a hp. Maybe I will buy a laser printer.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"This was an Open Box purchase. Probably was returned because it was defective. Sound was very scratchy when plugged in. The molding on plug prevented it from fully inserting into the cell phone jack (LG 220C flip phone).I trimmed the molding (which made the headset non-returnable) and discovered the the problem is a bad connection within the molded plug. I have read other reviews who had the same problem after a few months.When the sound worked, the ear phone was great. The ear cushion was comfortable.Never got a chance to test the microphone.I liked the sound well enough that I plan to replace the plug to get it to work.Plan on replacing this headset every few months due to defective wiring.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a pretty silly movie. The idea of someone holding up a place at gunpoint, taking hostages, and the hostages eventually sympathizing and siding with the robber... well, it's been done before and much better. The talent of Nia Long is wasted in this movie. Most of her screen-time takes place at the very beginning and end of the film.I gave this an extra star simply because Jamie Foxx has some funny moments in this. He's a major talent and really deserves to do better films than this. He's a great actor, both comic and dramatic.The DVD features certainly don't make up for the poor quality of the film. Besides the film's trailer (and a few trailers for other Trimark films) the only feature is a four minute interview with Jamie Foxx.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"A definitive statement from the 1980s music scene has been altered to the point of being a ""new"" and vastly inferior.Then embroiled in litigation over royalty payments that pitted bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake against Ozzy Osbourne, the 2002 reissue replaced the performances of the pair with bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin. The ""new"" album muddles the rhythm section to the point of making such incredible tracks like Crazy Train. Mr. Crowley and Goodbye to Romance sound like a medicre cover band at the corner bar on a slow Wednesday night.New fans may never hear the real music, since the original masters have been removed from the marketplace and replaced for all the wrong reasons.

By providing step-by-step instructions, sound nutritional knowledge, excellent examples, problem-specific narratives, and good, common sense day-to-day practices (i.e.-recipes), she is eliminating the frustration in the search for answers for current and future parents of children with ADHD. This book provides the type of aid that only could have been given by someone who has had first hand experience in raising children with ADHD. Parents can now learn what to do directly from the book rather than waiting while much of the medical community is playing catch-up to scientific literature.",,1

Heavy guitar solos like Midnight, Pali Gap and Peace in Mississippi really beef up the vocal tracks.

It also does justice to the tracks they just threw onto South Saturn Delta without any thought of album cohesion.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"After reading the first Lash Book about Eleanor & Franklin, I found The Years Alone to be a bit tedious with a lot of minutae about minor figures of the time. Most interesting parts were about her distrust of Kennedy because of his father & his Catholicism Although Eleanor was very liberal she had a distrust of the hidden designs of the Catholic Church based on life long encounters with it. Cardinal Spellman maintained a personal vendetta against her for being against giving public aid to Catholic schools & the long standing arch conservatism of the Catholic Church in civil rights & personal freedom. The Years Alone only touches on her achievements in welfare, refugee rights & disillusion with the Eisenhower administration & how her many talents were passed over by the Republicans.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I ordered this with some reservations as the reviews were hit and miss. I definitely fell in the miss category as the product I received did not roll smoothly at all. Being an engineer, I examined it (after all, how complex can a rolling pin be?) and found that the handle is somehow fitted eccentrically to the marble. The result is that instead of a smooth motion, the rolling pin rolls a few inches and then binds and locks up so the handles do not spin freely. I immediately contacted Amazon to return this product.It was an OK gamble given the price, but save yourself the trouble. In fact, I'd say that the use of marble and materials to make this product is just a waste of resources. I'd recommend looking for something that is fitted with nylon bearings at a minimum and stainless steel if you work a lot with pastry.

It's a little hard to put it on and take it off because it is narrow around the neck area.

The vibration mode, however, keeps running until you turn it off and is a great soother when the baby is fussy. One note of caution is that the wire frame legs extend out a bit from the seat itself.

It was terribly boring, no great travel shots and a waste of our time. Neither my mother nor myself are fans of Julia Roberts but thought perhaps this movie might be fine because of the travel. I only paid $1 from the kiosk rental but still not worth it. Save your money and time - even if on sale. I agree with another reviewer the companions in Italy were the most interesting part of the movie but never really developed the characters. The reason for the main character's up and leaving husband - the hopping in/out of bed from husband to flaky actor to sensual Javier Bardem. I could not emphathize with the character. Too self absorbed and she brought the unhappiness upon herself.

TONE_POLARITY,"Watched this one tonight for New Year's Eve and thought that this film was pretty good...in the beginning it does drag just a bit...but it quickly takes off with some twists and turns that you would not believe.A man is on death row for the murder of a woman, found dead on her living room floor, with her hands handcuff behind her back, a duct taped mouth and a plastic bag over her head that is duct taped around her throat. It is all signs of the perfect murder...but is it....watch this film and find out for yourself!!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who at the time was just about to turn 3. From day one she has loved it! I can honestly say that she would not love learning as much as she does now if it weren't for the LeapPad!The purple and pink was a great idea from the manufacturer, she was barely interested in the green and blue.In addition to the LeapPad, the organizers and books make it a tight system. It's very difficult to lose cartridges with the organizer.It's also very stable, it's been dropped, hanged (by the pen/cord), written on and RAINED ON and it's still working flawlessly. The pages are laminated so they don't get damaged or torn either!Overall this is the BEST purchase I've made for my daughter yet.

The capsule summaries have to be short, (or they wouldn't be capsules) but too often they fall flat, barely catching the essence of the film. Calling this book an ""Illustrated Guide"" is stretching the truth almost to the point of breaking. The illustrations are sparse, and aren't even from the cartoons themselves, but from advertisements for the films.It really pains me to be critical of the work, but there is enormous room for improvement.

TONE_POLARITY,"PLEASE buy ""Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man"" instead of this book and skip ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Yes, Moore makes some humorous points about where liberals (and conservatives) have gone wrong, and yes, if he means this book to be a total assault weapon against Bush, he succeeds. But his total disregard for his audience's intelligence and his endless whining about being booed by the Hollywood amoral Brain Trust spoil any good in this book.Although Mr. Moore is entitled to his opinion and the last time I checked, this is a free country, Mr. Moore is an intellectual coward who got trounced by Bill O'Reilly AND uber-left Vanity Fair critic Christopher Hitchens.

TONE_POLARITY,"Unfortunately, this author is one of many who misunderstand what Calvinism means. He views free-will and sovereignty as polar opposites. The more sovereignty exerted, the less room for free will there is. It's tragic, but oh so common when stuff like this gets into print. The reason is that he equates God's sovereignty with the type of sovereignty that man has the capacity to exert. With man, they would be polar opposites, but God's sovereignty is so much larger and greater than what we can exert that there is room for free-will to operate within the spectrum of God's sovereignty. There is no conflict or paradox, and nearly all Hunt's points are erroneous due to failing to understand this.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"OK I understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. I've heard both soundtracks. Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",,1

The characters, with the exception of the wife and father in law, were one dimensional. The plot was riddled with historical inaccuracies and the text was rife with misspelled words. It is sad to see what passes for gay literature these days. Save your money. This is one piece of pulpy fiction without much in the way of redeeming value. The sex scenes are not even gratifying.

I leased this second DVR for other household members and found it impossible to program and quite clumsy in operation. Why do I need to push the guide button twice just to see the channel guide?

I still listen to the CD today, but only selected tracks - most of which, sadly, aren't the tracks that Amazon chose to feature audio samples of (with the exception of the bitter ""I Love You""). A lot of the tracks on the first half of the album are somewhat bland folk-pop. But let me alert you to the jazzy tornado of ""For All These Years"" (trumpet by the great Mark Isham), the bluesy epic ""He Likes the Sun"" and what has got to be one of THE most wildly romantic ballads I have ever heard, ""Valentine Heart."" Those, with ""I Love You"" and ""Twist in My Sobriety,"" are wonderful, wonderful songs, and make the album worthy of buying.",,1

Another superweapon enters the picture: Death Star prototype, run by beings who are so inept its supposed to be funny but comes off just annoying. Kyp Durron returns to the light side, and Exar Khun is defeated but by the end of the story, Durron is treated like buddy not a mass murderer. It's simply not realistic. Admiral Daala comes back to provide Imperial presence but it's not really needed. Anderson tries but the book is to predictable and simply not all that good. Useless characters and plot lines abound.

They should know that this rather pricey DVD is only a single disc, a little over 2 hours in length. But the product description, both on Amazon and on the slip case, indicates a total running time of over 4 hours (250 minutes.) So you might be encouraged by this misinformation to drop the rather substantial sum of $25 for what appears to be a multi-disc set, or a series of programs. Not so.Like I said, it is a decent program. Good production values and very engaging. But not the 4 hour+ learning and entertainment experience it is touted as being!I'll revise my rating when the misinformation is corrected.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I love this book! I learned to cook pasta from my husband's Italian mother and grandmother and I thought I was doing well, but this book has refined and simplified my pasta dishes. The book is easy to read and easy to use with step-by-step directions. After making one of the tomato based sauces, my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! There are recipes for every type of pasta, too, using seafood (my favorite), herbs and oils, and cheese. Fresh pasta, store bought, how to cook it...whether you've been cooking pasta all your life or just learning how this book is perfect. The pictures alone make it worth while. I, also, purchased the author's Ultimate Bread book and love it as much as this one.",,1

I've read every one as soon as I could get my hands on them, and reread each so many times I'm afraid I will have to replace the books soon from sheer wear and tear. Shirley is the non politically correct, common sense first opposite of every fluff headed ""heroine"" that clutter too many mysteries.

TONE_POLARITY,"This Sam SP01 can be easily modded for use with the Oktava MK319. I found instructions through a google search. The metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed. Instead of hammering it out, I used two screwdrivers to pry it out. That leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use. Using my dremel tool, I was able to enlarge the hole just a bit. As a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove. You must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible. Then your Oktava will fit just fine. This mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting. I'll post up a picture later.I found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality. It wanted to cross thread as I putting it on my mic stand. So I wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently. That's my only complaint about it.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Great series but the packaging is sub-standard and many of the DVDs are scratched and scuffed, even when the product is bought new. The DVDs are housed in cardboard sleeves and it is very apparent that this is causing the scuffing and damage. Just as many others have complain, my entire season 3 is damaged to the point that it won't play on any DVD player. HBO should be ashamed of themselves and should provide replacements for the damaged discs. However, I have not had any success in getting a replacement.I would highly recommend avoiding this product, especially when you can purchase the seasons individually at a lower overall price. If you do buy it, remove all discs as soon as you receive them and place them in a ""real"" CD case with padded sleeves to prevent further damage.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"So often faerie plots wind up contrived adn silly; this one doesn't. It actually is very believeable. Eden is a midling sort of heroine; she changes and grows throughout the book and eventually becomes worthy of the title. But that comes at the end, so it hampers the story a bit. Hern/Hartley/Cornelius is superbly written, very strong, yet a touch vulnerable even as a Fane lord. The forklore is very well done as are several of the minor characters. Perhaps the wrong done is forgiven too easily, too quickly (except of course between the hero & heroine), but it's not much of a detriment. There are a couple of loose ends I'd like to have seen wrapped up. At the climax, I was crying so hard that I couldn't read the page. Not perfect, but an exceptional book well worth the read.",,1

Does not seem like I got a few lemons ... seems like a flat-out design flaw.

The happenings in the book, however, given the context of endless desert travel, seemed contrived: dust storms (of course - what else can happen in the desert?); childbirth; Tain's potshot; running out of water/food; desert predators; they all seemed inserted just because something needed to happen. Compare, for example, to The Key to Rebecca, where the trek across the desert was brutal, but it was only a lead-in to the story, not the story itself. I also found the book depressing. The ""victory"" at the end was not an uplifting triumph, it was a non-event, framed by an apparent huge loss of life (although we never find out how many perished).

This is one of the reasons that Joni Harms is special - her songs actually have a melody & deal with the themes usually associated with country music. The other reasons are that they are sung by a lady who has a great voice & alot of enthusiasm, & the songs are just good music - they are not over-produced & the musicians are playing traditional country music instruments; no synthesizers or wailing elctric guitars.

That's one of the things I loved so much about the book was how no one was perfect.

Marnie Quinn is either a pseudonym for the author, or the editor, or the milkman of the author, or of the editor, or...of Colonel Mustard for all I care.

TONE_POLARITY,"extreme conditions demand extreme responses was a little too simple but a good debut. brutal truth go experimenting here with hardcore punk and industrial but still manage to keep straight up grind in their music. my favorite on the album is godplayer, it starts out slow and industrialish, then gets insanely fast with kevin sharps screaming vocals. his lyrics are almost indecipherable which is a good thing, it makes the music more brutal. another thing i like about brutal truth is that they don't sing about satan or death like a lot of metal bands. they go against trends and sing political songs and songs about social issues. if you're just an average heavy metal fan this may be to brutal for you but if you like extreme stuff, buy this!",,1

I think it regularly sells for $60, and quite frankly, I would not be unhappy with it at that price either.

(I write in caps for emphasis.)After seeing this movie, I read a book. It had a plot and characters. And while I read it, I thought. I give the book I read 4 out of 5 stars -- minus one star because it didn't have cool-looking cartoons in it. But it had other stuff.In conclusion, I recommend books.",,1

This books takes you through extreme emotions, I came to feel sorry for a family of three generations that lived with bad choices, and bitterness that destroyed everyone in it. So be it, some families are like that, but when Ms Lowell introduced an incestous relationship, I was unsettled to say the least. She promoted a relationship that to me is imoral as well as illegal, I had a hard time finishing the book, and was unsettled by it for days. I am appalled that an author of her magnatude and influence, would even suggest such a relationship is proper.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I've owned this book for about a year now, and today when I realized how often I consult it for cooking and baking, I had to write a review. This cookbook offers far more than recipes! It offers basics of food preparation, suggestions and ideas for alternatives to standard recipes, some background information on where particular dishes originated, and just general helpful hints. I use this book whether I'm creating something on my own in the kitchen, trying a recipe from a friend or another cookbook, or preparing one of Mark Bittman's dishes. Today I was looking for a recipe for pizza dough, and found myself caught up in reading an entire section! The instructions are clear and concise, and the language draws in even cooks with the most casual interest. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys food preparation - regardless of their skill level. This is a fantastic reference and cookbook, and would make a great gift!",,1

As an avid reader I could not get past the third or fourth chapter- it was hopelessly dull, and mind-numbingly doctrinaire.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Marly Chance is a young writer who definitely knows how to write great steamy novels. Oath of Seduction is a fast read with no extraordinary plot, but it kept me hooked from the first page to the last!If you are like me, looking for a hot read with a bit more than just emotionless get-to-the-act characters, this book should be for you. The futuristic setting reminds me a bit of ""Warrior's woman"" from Johanna Lindsey. If you liked this book and are up for a more risqué reading then do not hesitate further...And if you like strong woman with strong personality that keep men at bay with snappy retort, read the 2nd book of the series: Oath of Challenge (have a look on her website marlychance.com).",,1

The carafe's design is disappointing. Although it does not drip, the configuration is annoying: the handle is open at the botton (not a good idea if one wants to clean it in a dishwasher); the rim collects water inside and outside so that hand-washing necessitates hand drying. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, the water-level gauge on the side of the unit is quite narrow and difficult to see (we drew a mark with on the level that we use most).",,1

EVERY song is excellent and evokes a passionate response from the listener. The arranging of the music is perfect, which is sometimes hard to imagine with the amount of lyrics Peter Garret tries to ""fit"" into a melody. From the working mans songs :Blue Sky Mine, and King of the Mountain to the smoky, Mountains of Burma,and rythmic Antarctica, you are transported through every range of emotion and can find common threads no matter where you are from; I'm a Canadian.

In addition to their music, they've got a pretty funny vibe, as they poke fun in their songs and at their concerts.

Juanito is the son of migrant workers from Mexico. Neither of his parents had the opportunity to complete school, but realize the importance of education. When Juanito reaches school age, his parents settle down so that he may regularly attend. At first the new schedules feel strange to Juanito and he is often doing the wrong thing during designated times. However, once he adjusts, he discovers his beautiful singing voice, artistic talent, and receives high marks for a poem he wrote. He and his parents are proud of the success Juanito finds in school despite the challenge of adapting to an unfamiliar language and culture. The vibrant illustrations promote the positive feeling towords multiculturalism portrayed in this picture storybook.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Why this music does not get played on the majority of radio stations is no mystery to me. It shows great talent, is tuneful, one can actually understand the lyrics, and it addresses social issues. Not the typical stuff that is played these days on the airwaves of popular music. I feel fortunate that the rest of the world has not discovered what Hornsby fans already know. This allows us to enjoy his music live in small intimate theaters where the joy and passion of his music is best experienced. He is a consummate musician who can play virtually any style with ease and continues to challenge himself and the musicians that he surrounds himself with. ""Spirit Trail"" is yet another classic in the Bruce Hornsby canon. Just like a fine wine, he continues to get better.",,1

Since then I have tried to play prelude 2 (I) and prelude 24 (II) that is extremly beautiful though not easy to play, and I have listened all preludes and some fugues from CD or midi files with this book opened in front of me. I realized how great Bach's music is. Only complaint is that the cover of the book isn't glued strong enough, which is now seperated from the content pages already after only a short period use. Also, the prelude 1 (book I) is probably the correct version, but I have seen from some other books the other version with an extra measure between bar 22 and 23. I now play it with the extra measure since it seems making sense to me.",,1

It's a little tricky to hold the unit, turn the handle and also push the items through at the top. Might be better if you have someone to help. Also, when working with fresh quartered tomatoes, it's a little bit difficult to crank through the first time.

This is a ""serious"" game which requires alot of repetitive work and a huge time investment.Unless you are a student with nothing better to do all summer, don't buy this game. You need to invest at least 4 hours a day to be successful in the game.On the positive side, the combat system is alot of fun. Going on a hunting expedition with a bunch of other players is cool.

Well, I learned nothing new and wasted my money. Although I expected the book to be positive about Tony Robbins, I was surprised that it was written in such a sycophantic manner. It was also very poorly written and had all the elements of a rush job. Mr Bolduc would benefit from a basic writing course and some research skills. It looked to me that he was wondering how he could profit from his association with Tony Robbins and figured that writing a book was the only way possible.

TONE_POLARITY,"WHEELOCK'S LATIN is clear, well-organized, and brief. There's only a few pictures and not much talk about Roman history, but for those of us who are serious about wanting to learn Ancient Latin, their absence is not sorely missed.Since the chapters are short (about 5-7 pages in most cases) the book is ideal for self-study. I would add, however, that whether studying in school or on your own, but especially this latter, the addition of a companion guide will prove to be invaluable.For this, I recommend Grote's COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO WHEELOCK'S LATIN -- a book that offers a little more repetition, fuller grammatical explanations, and is written in a calm, reassuring style.

TONE_POLARITY,"I guess other people love this shovel, but I can't stand it. It's really heavy. It's very unbalanced, with all the weight in the shovel head, making it very heavy to lift. I cannot get ANY leverage with it. I live in Maine where you're often having to lift the snow to pile it up on a snow bank (sometimes banks that are 3 to 5 feet tall), or dump it over the railing off my porch. I find the bent handle means I'm having to lift much higher and it takes a lot more twisting to get the snow off. Also, it's very difficult to lift the snow off my steps with it, and the bent handle makes it hard to shovel them from above, so I have to trudge through the snow down to the base of the steps and shovel from below. This is a lot more effort!When I use traditional shovel,I never experience any of the back pain that folks are talking about.

TONE_POLARITY,This is Nirvanas 3rd album.Its some of their more early stuff.Its got at least 5 really great songs on it. The picture on the cover is something that I think is pretty cool. The name is a little wierd but its from Nirvana so youve gotta love it.There is a remix for the song Polly on this cd which is a great song off their earlier cd Nevermind.The best song on the whole cd is Anyerism which has cool lyrics and sounds great.This isnt the best cd from Nirvana.In Utero is the best cd they ever made but its from Nirvana so I like it.Its worth your money.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This book is not *completely* useless, but I've got to say it's the worst one on Pagan and magickal practice I own. There are a few good recipes and a few mildly useful spells and lists, but then there's far too much inaccuracy, some really lousy and dangerous magickal ethics and several laughably bad attempts at high magickal language. The worst and funniest--I laughed off and on for the rest of the week--is a spell to call wind . It's very impressive-looking in a Ceremonial-Magick-tinged kind of way, and might even work....except it calls ALL FOUR CARDINAL WINDS AT ONCE. Why am I suddenly picturing Ms. Dunwich being dervished away to Oz? <g>",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Not only does this book explain many hunches I've had for decades (like who's full of baloney versus not) but it is also a great tool for recruiting sales people.

Both units assembled quickly and operate smoothly and silently. Package includes spare nuts & bolts in case a few get lost. These bases make a small shop workable, allowing effortless machine movement to accomodate material & workflow, facilitate clean-up, and change arrangement to accomodate new ""toys."" Caveat: Unless you have help to lift heavy machines into the assembled bases, it is necessary to assemble the bases around the machine; however, by tilting the machine up on a few 2 x 4 blocks, there is plenty of ground clearance to do that easily.

TONE_POLARITY,"While the producers kept this movie more in line with the Batman comic book style of the late 1940's and 1950's, even to the point of using vintage autos, this is a bad movie in too many ways to count. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Batman's arch enemy Mr. Freeze and it is his worst acting job ever, with the other players not far behind. Some of the action scenes are so artificially contrived that they have you snickering and the dialog is at times seemingly directly lifted from the dialog balloons of a 1950's comic book.This is without question the worst of the Batman movie series that began with the classic starring Michael Keaton. While those with a historical interest in the Batman character may find the retro concept interesting, everyone else will find it tedious and dull.",,0

The author did nothing to develop the characters and portrayed them as shallow, petty, stupid, jealous people who were, for the most part, unlikeable.The story line was imbued with inaccuracies where both computer technology and the travel industry were concerned, and these inaccuracies highlight the authors obvious lack of research. I almost begged for Diane and Jeff to simply ""get on with it"" as the supposed romantic portion of this lame storyline dragged on and on. If the overuse of adverbs is your thing, then this book is definitely for you, but in reality I was almost driven crazy by them.

TONE_POLARITY,"Vampire Boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. This movie is pretty dull stuff. Even Twilight was better. And the actor who played Caleb was horrible. A lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. I think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""Pretty Boys"" instead. That's the point of this movie anyway. The point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. That counts for something, right?",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"First, the cover design rocks. I was one of the people who thought this was a paranormal romance, but it's more of a science fiction mystery. It's a darker story about an alien hunter, Mia, who has to work with a dangerously attractive -- and plain dangerous -- alien because her partner will die if she doesn't. It's one of those who-do-you-trust? stories and I liked it a lot once I got into it. I was reminded of the politics of non-humans vs. humans in Charlaine Harris's novels.",,1

THE OZZMAN COMETH is a collection of Beezle-Boob's so-called career highs (I'll skip the easy joke), mostly focusing on his post-Sabbath output, save a couple of throwaway ""new versions"" of BS classics. The Randy Rhoads-propelled early hits CRAZY TRAIN and I DON'T KNOW represent Ozzy's best solo work; that era's power sorely is diminished by later synth-intrusive power ballad dreck like MAMA I'M COMING HOME and IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER. There's nothing here that Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done better, with at least a fundamental grasp on harmony.

TONE_POLARITY,"I've been taking Sundown Xtra for several years and have found it to be an excellent product. In order for folic acid to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels, it needs to be taken in conjunction with Vitamin 6 & 12, This product allows you to get the benefit of a maximum dose of folic acid (800mcg) and the necessary Vitamin B's ALL in ONE caplet. Much easier than having to buy folic acid and Vitamin B complex *separately* in order to properly augment. Although recent studies have questioned the relevance of homocysteine levels regarding cardiac health, I believe there's a great deal of merit in continuing to take folic acid. My homocysteine levels decreased substantially (from a 14 to an 8) after taking this folic acid/Vitamin B complex combination for six months. I would strongly recommend it.

What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book.

Dave Marr is probably one of, if not THE best songwriters in country music today. I don't really listen to what passes for country radio, and I was lucky (blessed even?) to find out about The Star Room Boys back in the glory days of Napster.

TONE_POLARITY,"Now, I must admit one night I was sitting watching television and I heard her ministering on TV about some things and she mentioned this book coming out. At that point I felt the Holy Spirit and thought it was so coincidental for me to see her right at that moment, because I NEVER watch television and so on and so forth. So, I jumped on-line and pre-ordered the book. I struggled to somewhere in the 2nd chapter and then put it to the side. There was no God or Holy Spirit ministering in that book. I either threw it away or gave it away. The sound of God is very distinct and if it wasn't in the 1st 2 chapters I wasn't wasting my time trying to find him in the rest of it. So, if you are anointed, set apart, prophetic, peculiar don't look to hear your fathers voice in this one. Sorry!",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Although the season has great episodes, especially the 2nd half with the transitioned to HD, this box set fails to include any special feature what so ever. First off, no commentaries; The commentaries are the reason these sets sell because it makes a detail description on the process on how the episodes came to be, both good and bad episodes. Second, no 20th Anniversary feature where the cast and crew discuss on their experiences on working on the show for 20 years. And finally, no intro from Matt Groening; it feels that Groening had no involvement on this release, thus making it an unofficial box set.For those fans who just want to see the episodes and don't care for the features, this set is a must buy. For the rest, I suggest avoid this product and wait for the eventual box set with all the special features, including The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special in 3D on Ice!, in the near future.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I first read ""The Lottery"" in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I bought this book for the title story, and it is the most powerful of the stories, though the others are also very entertaining. Hopefully it will also stay with you.Ms Jackson is a phenomenally talented writer. You know immediately that there is something wrong with the simple village lottery, and the suspense and horror builds with every word. That this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.""The Lottery"" is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written. Shirley Jackson is a master, and her novels ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" are also engrossing reads. But ""The Lottery""? Well, you will never forget the twist in the tale.",,1

Luckily, I picked it up the other day, and now can't put it down. The characters are lovingly and carefully crafted as is the story. the tale of a young Chinese man who is sent to a small village in Japan to recover. Set in ww2, the tensions between Chinese and Japanese enter into the story, as does love and infidelity. The writer weaves together the angst of illness, personal loss, war, with the lovely moments and relationships that make life joyfill without ever falling into the trap of cliche or false aentiment.

While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other ""energy"" bars on the market that are packed with sugars.

Finally went. Called Magellan in August 2007, received a Return Authorization. They supposedly have a 14 day return policy. Well it is now almost November again and after numerous calls to Magellan still no GPS. They use outsourced phone representatives, so you can not be assured that they actually understand what you are saying and I have had a very hard time understanding them most times. After numerous promises that the replacement GPS is on the way and refusal to provide a tracking number as of today I got off the phone with them and started filing complaints with the BBB and the attorney general. Pay more and stay away from Magellan. They don't care about you once they have your $$$.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"This book's title is, in part, ""The Rise of Darth Vader."" Little attention, however, is actually paid to that topic. The book is in some instances a quick review of what led Anakin to choose the path of the Dark Side of the Force, but provides nothing but primer in the way of Darth Vader becoming the feared being he is in Star Wars: ANH. Perhaps fine as a story in and of itself, but potential readers should not buy this book if their clear goal is learning anything new about our villain's history between Episodes III and IV.",,0

""Kiss of the Dragon"" is one of hopefully a few mistakes that Li will make in his just-beginning career. The film's plot is confusing and, if understood, boring. The film makes no effort what-so-ever in making an actual good story. Instead, we jump from fight scene to fight scene dodging huge plot holes and receiving dumb dialogue. The fight scenes are mostly pretty good, especially a random scene where Li fights off a troupe of ninjas. But the film lacks interesting characters and Bridgette Fonda's terrible acting doesn't help the film at all. I like Jet Li. I know he can do better. Hopefully this won't be a big step down in his career.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I ordered this thinking it would work well and hoping it would also swing the top indepedently from the bottom. I could not tell from the description if it did this. When I assembled it which was realatively easy even with my arthritic hands, it did not swing separate from the legs. The handle in the photo controls the verticle raising and lowering. The lowest setting is a bit high for the standard rocker recliner chair I use it next to but still workable. The highest setting is very high and it is apparent that this was designed to work with a bed that raises more than with a chair or sofa, though it can with the latter if a bit high. The bottom wheel area is less high than many of the tables I have seen but still did not fit under my chair. A good and solid product in all, but if you need the top to swivel without the legs not the right choice for you.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"As other reviewers have noted, this book is compromised by two serious flaws. One, rats turn out to be an insuffiently engaging subject for a micro-history of this sort. I don't feel like I learned much about them that was particularly interesting or unexpected, and the book feels padded. Two, Sullivan is a lousy writer. His prose is rambling and disorganized. He makes spelling errors, misuses words, uses tenses in disagreement, and more. Was this book even edited, I wondered? I doesn't seem like it. The yarns he spins to pad the book are not very interesting and tend to petter out without going anywhere. He wrote a book about himself writing a book about rats, and it's not a good one.",,0

But the characterizations are skewed and lacking, and changes made for this movie almost always moves it away from the charming stage classic.Musical numbers are eliminated, and the shows best known song, Try to Remember, is included briefly at the end as an afterthought that it had to be represented.There are some things that work here, and if you have not seen the show you may even enjoy it.

The RFC understand very well that Baroque music is all about rhetorical gestures (""Affekten"").

TONE_POLARITY,"Masterton has written a *lot* of books, of which I've read a few. Of those, I'd have to place this one somewhere in the middle.It starts out great, builds on some interesting ideas about the flexibility of time, if you use the right kind of architecture, and keeps your attention and continues to be creepy for about 3/4 of the way. Then it seems like Masterton gets lazy and relies on some horror cliches that will make anyone who has seen a few horror films groan. One of the characters even thinks to himself that the situation he's in is like the film ""Don't Look Now"". The characters do things like walk around a spooky house separately when they know it's dangerous. That's like a joke out of the first ""Scream"" movie!

My favorite games were in the late 80's early '90s when game play was paramount over flashy graphics.I purchased this program after trying it out for a few weeks via Freeverse's website. This game is very similar to Activision's 80's version of Shanghai -- except that it's gorgeous to look at, has terrific gameplay, and is ...(insert drum roll here) ...loads of FUN!I prefer games that are easy to get into, and continue to hold my interest over time. This review would be 5 stars, but I took down one star because under MacOSX 10.3, I can't play any of the audio tracks on the game. Freeverse software has indicated that a patch will be made available soon.Highly recommended, especially for non-gamers that want a good, fun diversion every now and then. Perfect for kids and adults alike!",,1

Both trays were great at keeping food warm, and more than one guest swore they were going to rush off and buy them as well. They clean up easily and were the hits of the party. My one complaint is that on the temperature dial, the ""off"" setting does not work. The only way to turn the unit off is to unplug it from the wall. (It seems to work fine on the 3-tray unit so it's apparently a fluke.) Still, I'm not the type to leave heating appliances plugged in when not in use to begin with, so I'm not overly concerned. You probably shouldn't leave these running unattended in the first place. Fabulous purchases and highly recommended.",,1

Either way, if you haven't read Frank's Diary, I highly recommend reading it ASAP! If you have, I highly recommend reading it AGAIN as soon as you can! Anne Frank is so strong, brave, and far beyond her years. In the worst of times, she shows the curiousity, and hope of a young child. She remains so positive throughout. There is definitely a reason why her diary is so widely recognized, and taught throughout schools. Everyone can learn a little something, or be more appreciative, thankful, for the life they do have, and freedoms we often take for granted, after reading it.

As far as collections go, ""Gnarl!"" is becomingly introspective, and can be read as a transrealist autobiography. Rucker creates grim futures and funny scenarios that cover the spectrum of human emotion. Pac-Man addiction. Religious fervor. Microgravity sex. Beatniks and hydrogen bombs. Time warps and deranged aliens. ""Gnarl!'s"" got it all. You can't come away from the experience unmoved.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Fans of the current ""Nikita"" TV series should be warned that this earlier version of the show is much darker and more violent. From the end of Season 2 on, it takes a very different direction as Nikita gradually becomes a willing member of Section 1 (Division). Also, this show makes frequent use of graphic sadomasochistic themes, and there seems to be at least one torture scene in every episode. In fact, Section 1 often behaves more like the Gestapo than a rogue branch of the CIA. The suggestion here is that this is justified, and there is a strong neoconservative political undercurrent to the show. Many of the episodes end in tragedy, and I found this series to be a major turnoff. Two much better programs in this genre are ""Alias"" and ""MI-5."" I would recommend both of them over this show.",,0

It is a typical rebellious teen additude of feeling left out because now more than ever he feels that he can contribute to the ""Cause"" as an equal. Unfortunatly Harry is still treated like a kid which only angers him futher. For those that have watched Star Wars, this is the Empire Stikes Back of the series. To me Dylan Thomas the poet has said it best for the theme of this book and that is ""Do not go gentle into that good night"", ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""",,1
TONE_POLARITY,This is such a great workout and not boring like so many other DVD's. It's a tough workout not matter how many times I use it and really incorporates great yoga moves with strengthening work and overall muscle toning.,,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Why is it so hard to find a good nose trimmer?? about ten years ago I bought an excellent Panasonic brand trimmer-- a model they apparently no longer make- -but lost it a few years back. I bought this one thinking it would be comparable. Wow, was I wrong. not only did it not trim very effectively, it broke after only a few months. it's not worth the hassle of sending it back in for repair. steer clear of this one.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I gave it 5 stars because, although no saw in the ""portable range"" IMHO is perfect....THIS ONE is PERFECT for me. Comments about no blade lock, ambiguous blade angle determination, and a few others, are all justified, but those are generally only found on SHOP saws which have bigger tables, twice the cost [approx], and are considerably heavier. Again, it's all about what works for you. This puppy is a dream to slide on to the bed of a pickup [check out YouTube for the skinny on how it's done]. As for complaints about the quality [or lack of] of the saw blades, consider this! Absolutely no manufacturer supplies their saws with high quality blades. PERIOD!!",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"This is a must have for Vampire fans, be they cultural, literary, historical, or film vampires. This book isn't a one stop book on vampire, but it's a good reference. It covers different kind of vampires in different culture, historical vampires, literary vampires (up to 1993), and vampires on film. This book doesn't even need to be for reference, I read it cover to cover.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I received this CD as a gift a few years ago. Unfortunately, it sat unopened for waaaaay to long. To my delight, when I did listen to it , I was wonderfully surprised. This is a CD to listen to when you are harried and headed for burn-out. It unwinds me, it clears my mind, and I can think about whatever I want to think about. It is a quiet, gentle, peacefull presentation of songs that you don't mind hearing, when they are presented in this style. I enjoy this CD long after Christmas. I don't listen to any other Christmas music beyond the Holiday, save this album and a really great recording of the Nutcracker Suite.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I have two daughters ages 4 and 6, I have read the other reviews about strings breaking and such. We had our sky dancer now for a year. At first my youngest did have trouble pulling the string, but once my oldest daughter and I showed her how to pull, she did not have any trouble. Camille flew wonderfully untill about a week ago when my cat developed a fetish for her wings. My suggestion to those parents thinking of buying one is this. My daughter is 4 and it took her a little while to understand how hard to pull this string. I don't recomend it for kids under 4. Also if you do have a cat you might want to put the doll up at night. I have given a 4 star rating on education for both hand eye coordination and control. I will be buying two more for christmas this year. Personally I think it's a great toy and a nice addition to a childs playthings.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"A must-have book on trading. Why? It really forces you to think for yourself. To paraphrase a well-know fishing analogy, teach someone a system, they trade for a while...help someone to think and they can trade for a lifetime.And trade is the key word, you are not investing, etc, but placing your psyche and cash on the line. Each of the ""rules"" gives you the chance to think through a critical concept and come to grips with what can work with you.Each ""rule"" is clearly and concisely developed. No BS or watered-down drivel. Each is consistent within the larger picture.I could write more for you to read here, but your time would be much better spent reading Jankovsky's 28 Rules for yourself.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Well as a newbie to horse racing, all the data at hand was quite overwhelming. I mean where does one start? While perusing the web I came across this book. I'm so glad that I did! This book has everything you need to get down to some intelligent betting. My first application of the knowledge I got from this book was quite successful (got the trifecta on my very fist try, and these weren't favorites! Also was in the money for all the other races I bet that day (4)... Beginners luck?). Now I have a good basic understanding and a bit of confidence when betting.The only reason this book got 4 stars is that it lacks a glossary.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I purchased the Refill Kit from Stratitec on Amazon. While they said the refill kit was compatible with my printer, they failed to mention that my printer cartridges could NOT be refilled. Once I got the ink, I found out I had to spend another $50 to buy refillable cartridges...",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"Amos Tutuola is one of the handful of master stylists in English of the 20th century. ``Witch-herbalist of the Remote Town'' is a mature work. Comparing it with his first published work (``Palm-wine Drinkard'') demonstrates that Tutuola is, in fact, a stylist and not, as it once seemed possible, a naive product of an unusual and scanty education in English in Nigeria. The compelling factor in his style is rhythm, presumably related to his mother tongue of Yoruba. It has something of the cyclical nature of extended drumming -- it is hard to stop reading it. Plot and characterization are not important in Tutuola's writing. ``Witch-herbalist'' is a simple story of a father's love for his child.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"Filled with generic advice, misleading information, and outdated questions, Kaplan should be avoided. Ironically, I used to be a Kaplan teacher myself and I hate the way Kaplan claims to prepare students for the test. That's why now I try to do private tutoring on my own. I would recommend that serious students buy The College Board's ""10 Real SATs"" for real practice, and may wish to look at Princeton Review's ""Cracking the SAT"", although the language used is kindergarten style.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"I LOVE this peeler. The serrated edge allows it to pierce the skin of fruits and veggies and it just glides along so nicely. Also, the metal eye remover on the end works very well, much better than peelers with plastic eye removers. I know they call it a ""soft-skin"" peeler, but I've used it on potatoes and apples and eggplant with beautiful results. Since we got it, we now fight over who gets to peel the veggies! That never happened before!",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I have to admit that I really didn't think much about Johnny Cash until I saw Walk the Line. I always thought he was cool, but didn't know much about his music. After watching the movie I decided to pick up a ""best of"" type album. I definitely feel like I picked the right one. Man, he had a great voice and you get to hear him at the top of his game at different points in his career. If you like Johnny Cash, or are a little curious about his music, this is a great CD set. I defnitely recommend it.",,1
TONE_POLARITY,"I was very disappointed in this scale. I was hoping it would match the weight at the Weight Watcher Center where I attend classes. I loved the design and the fact that it had the partial pounds that my old scale does not. However, I never could get this scale to weigh even close to the old one and one time within four hours I had lost 11 pounds. Since that is not possible I was forced to return this scale and stick with my old one.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"I can't say that this book was anywhere near one of the best true crime books I have ever read, but it did make for some interesting reading. I put off purchasing this book many times because although I like true crime, I am really not enthusiastic about reading stories where innocent babies are murdered, by their own mother nonetheless. It was pitiful the way this woman snuffed out the lives of her innocent children, and for no obvious reason. Hard to believe that when her babies were dying one by one in the 1960's, no one thought it peculiar. If this were happening to someone I know now, I would certainly think something was up. This woman makes you very angry. Being in her seventies now, her age seems to have played a part in her punishment. I have no pity for her, 27 or 70, it makes no difference. She is a murderer, plain and simple.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"I found the original version of Firebird in a used bookstore over a decade ago. I have to confess, I initially bought it because I liked the cover! But then something strange happened when I tried to read it -- I couldn't put the book down. I was so caught up in the tale of Firebird and Brennen that I read it from cover to cover in almost 1 sitting.I was not disappointed with the new version. All of the characters that I liked so much were intact, and given extra dimensions to their personalities. I plan to read Fusion Fire (the sequel) as soon as possible.",,1

TONE_POLARITY,"Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul. Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message. Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction. An excellent film to all, not just art historians.",,0
TONE_POLARITY,"It seems that I'm the only person in the world who has read Hyperion and not loved it. I found the independent stories mostly unbelievable and stupid - let's take Rachel's story, for example; isn't it classic scifi in the negative sense of the term? A simple idea, looks brilliant on paper but turns out to be impossible to do well enough? The same can be said of the whole epic. Simmons just rushed head over heels into something he couldn't handle. And the basic plot drags on without awaking a spark of interest in me. I'm just glad it stopped before the climax; now I only have to avoid the rest of the series so that I'll never have to know what sorry idiocies our beloved author made up for the ending.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"Don't waste your money! Seriously, it's so bad. So boring. It got worse and worse. The two dramatic turns could be seen a mile away. At least when I started I had the hope it would get better...once it ended I was left feeling like a shmuck for buying it, let alone reading it. NOT what I expect from Ms Steel. I'm shocked they allowed her to publish it. Did anyone else notice the grammar errors? The repeating of things, word for word? I can't remember the last time I've read a book I hated so much. Maybe never. I normally don't keep reading, but I was so mad to have splurged on it....I ignored the inner screams of despair. DON'T SUFFER THE SAME FATE! I gave one star only because Amazon won't allow ZERO.",,0

TONE_POLARITY,"A warning to those thinking of purchasing this DVD. I purchased it on the basis of the glowing reviews posted here. Reviews that called this flawless, brilliant, the greatest TV program ever, etc. I confess that I only watched 2 episodes before putting this one away. It is extremely disturbing. The imagery in it is grotesque, potentialy offensive, and deeply disturbing. If you are a viewer who considers anything gross that pushes the boundries of acceptability art, then you will like this show. But if you are not entertained by depressing and disturbing images and topics, stay away from this one. Many people found the movie Silence of the Lambs about a murderous cannibal ""brilliant and entertaining."" If you loved Silence of the Lambs you will probably love this too. Otherwise think twice before buying this title.",,0
