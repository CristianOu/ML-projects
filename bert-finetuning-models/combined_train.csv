The songwriting is downright amateurish and Stevens doesn't get a chance to shred the way he obviously can. I'd like to see what he could do in a Jeff Beck-Blow By Blow type of context. Here, it sounds like he has recycled songs that weren't good enough to make it onto a Motley Crue disc (and that ain't good!). The singer makes Vince Neil sound like Paul Rodgers.

We now have beautiful mountain pictures that we can enlarge and print. I've already done some printing and the pictures look like 35mm photos. I have read that some people complain about having to process the pictures through special software. We tried this processing, but didn't see a difference. We have very vivid color just using our regular photo editor. It isn't time consuming to use the Minolta software though. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.

The inherent humor in the scenario of one man observing another is explored, not exploited, in an intelligent and witty fashion. I particularly enjoyed the fact that whole scenes would pass with no dialogue at all. Also noteworthy was the cinematography, which gave everything a handsome Nordic sheen.My second source of enjoyment were the reviews posted herein; it's rare to see so many good reviews so unanimous in their praise of a work, whether book, CD, or movie. I will safely assume that KITCHEN STORIES attracts viewers of only the highest caliber.",,1.0

If you have a good voice, as I give that Justin does, ballads are a piece of cake, but to write and sing a song that really get's people moving, that is so much more of a challenge.

There's nothing here that Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done better, with at least a fundamental grasp on harmony.

Plus, the three workouts follow a goofy upper body, lower body, whole body split, which is presumably borrowed from body building, but makes no sense in martial arts training where movements are not designed to isolate muscle groups.Hackleman's second home work out DVD ""Crosspit"" fixes many of these shortcomings and is a much better product.",,0.0

Plus there's the creepiness factor in that the two old ladies practically kept him prisoner, refusing to let the authorities know they'd found him, apparently unconcerned that someone somewhere might be worried about him. And why make the pretty stranger seem so evil when all she wanted was to take the fellow under her wing and help him fly? Why add the pretense of danger (Oh no!

Despite the mysterious tone of the film, which offers some surprises along the way, this is an average effort overall, since the pacing is too slow at parts and the ending isn`t too satisfying.

In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. He does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. The up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blasé to those not in the industry. The down side is that McPhee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. Because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others.

Only recommended for those who *must* have all 4 of Karajan's sets -- it's not truly terrible, by any stretch, but it's mediocre, and at this price you can do far better elsewhere.If you're looking for a ""vintage"" (1940's or earlier) Beethoven set, try Furtwangler (my personal fave), or perhaps Toscanini.

The reason is that he equates God's sovereignty with the type of sovereignty that man has the capacity to exert. With man, they would be polar opposites, but God's sovereignty is so much larger and greater than what we can exert that there is room for free-will to operate within the spectrum of God's sovereignty.

Sharks are very rarely known to eat humans, in fact, you are more at risk of getting struck by lightning than by getting eaten by a shark. When sharks do attack humans it is mostly because they have been confused and have mistaken you for other prey. This is why after the shark bites it usually swims away.When people look at the cover of the book, they might think that it will be about a shark who goes on a killing rampage, but the book is not mainly about the shark, most of it is about a lady who wants to get sexually involved (for some unknown reason) to a man other than her husband. This takes away from the excitement and is very boring to read. The conclusion is also very bad because it doesn't end with a sense of finality. It just ends when the shark eats a man and another man that was on the boat with him swims to shore.",,0.0

This production is typical of the Mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. I did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. No fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.Clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment.

I have used other ""Dummies"" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that ""it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse"" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage.",,0.0

Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, ""Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's ""The Orange Album"" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut.

He gives interesting examples of coincidences and, unlike other books on coincidence I've read, ""translates"" them--looking beyond the ""oh, isn't that interesting"" to get to the possible message and meaning.His theory that coincidences are similar to dreams and can be interpreted as such changed my whole perception of coincidences.

Mills, makes his point on why good vision is so important and then tells us how to develop our attention to make us safer drivers. You can read this book in one sitting and learn ways to become a safer driver -- it could save your life. It contains many of the things you always wanted to tell your new teen-aged driver, but didn't really know how to explain.

And yet it's all handled with such cold, distant narration that it's impossible, as a reader, to care.Little surprise, then, that in a collection of twelve dramatic, explosion-filled issues, the most striking and memorable moment is a quiet scene halfway through in which a normally unreadable character collapses to his knees at the side of his giant dog and hugs him.It's among the few moments of real weakness, conflict or feeling in the entire ponderous volume.The artwork usually manages to be delicate and intimate, but even the powerful illustrations can't compensate for a lifeless script.The Inhumans ultimately serves as a long, rich, vivid description of nothing.",,0.0

The book is boring and fast-paced, and it seems like Jane Leslie Conly has perhaps watered down the writing, perhaps to make it less difficult. The book got considerably better in the end, but still it was poorly written and boring. The plot was actually quite good, but the way everything went so quickly was confusing, and yes, I didn't like it. It was also too long for such a dull book. Usually I would think that 278 pages is short, but the way it drags on, it was a slow read for me. However, some parts were interesting, nevertheless, the first one was much better.

Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly.",,1.0

Mind is not Brain is by far the most mature and well rounded of the three, their best to date and the best rock out there today. It's just plain cutting edge. The sound is new and original, the songs are more complete and the singing is right on. The Great Mock Orange will finally get the respect they deserve for this masterpiece of music.

But this cd seperates them by far now. Joe even colleberates with N'Sync, and not being a big fan of them, I kinda like this song.The standout's are: I wanna Know, Treat Her Like A Lady, One Life Stand, and the Remix to Thank God I Found You.I think Joe has another classic on his hands and I am happy to see him having even more success.

TONE_POLARITY,"Masterton has written a *lot* of books, of which I've read a few. Of those, I'd have to place this one somewhere in the middle.It starts out great, builds on some interesting ideas about the flexibility of time, if you use the right kind of architecture, and keeps your attention and continues to be creepy for about 3/4 of the way. Then it seems like Masterton gets lazy and relies on some horror cliches that will make anyone who has seen a few horror films groan. One of the characters even thinks to himself that the situation he's in is like the film ""Don't Look Now"". The characters do things like walk around a spooky house separately when they know it's dangerous. That's like a joke out of the first ""Scream"" movie! And there are scenes that will remind readers too much of ""The Shining"".Because this book started out so well, I can rate it higher than Masterton's ""Basilisk"", but it comes nowhere near the level of ""The Hell Candidate"" and ""House of Bones"", both of which I recommend.",,0.0

After all, it took his brother (governor's) help and the support of his daddy-appointed, supreme court justices to sneak him into office. This administration and the fools who back it are all LIARS who don't follow what's really going on. Great job Al Franken and the team from Harvard! I salute you as a true American. Only we true Americans know what's really going on! For you Bush backers, WAKE UP from your Walmart-shopping stupor! He's only using you for votes whilst he erodes our tax base and environmental and domestic policies to help out the super rich. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU!!!",,1.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I read all the good reviews and was looking forward to receiving this book. I was extremely disappointed. Although the premise was excellent, I found the story to be jumpy and hard to follow. Just when you got to know characters, it was time to move on. I kept waiting for the 'real' part to actually begin. There was no flow and I couldn't have cared less what happened to the hero in the end. I never even read the last 60 pages. I just couldn't do it.",,0.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I liked this book a lot. It was boring at first, but it got better. Hearing about the Titanic from a survivor would be really rare. There are funny parts, sad parts, twists and turns, and a little romance thrown in for edge-of-your-seat reading before the Titanic sinks. Margaret is a fourteen-year-old from England who is going to join her brother in America. She lived at an orphanage for girls run by nuns, and is chosen by Sister Catherine as a companion for Mrs. Carstairs and her dog. It is very exciting, especially the parts about the Titanic just before it sank. A wonderful book!",,1.0

TONE_POLARITY,"I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time ""chicken and liver"" from the same company. I'm praying.",,0.0
