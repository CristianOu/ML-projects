The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action.",,0.0

As a black woman growing up in small town Georgia in the '40s, I experienced the typical incidents of racism, but I've experienced much worse in other places! Blacks and whites in Eatonton get along very well and have for many years. There are numerous black elected officials there at both the city and county levels.

It's enough people. We cannot look at Pink Floyd through The Wall only and after 30 years. Will they try to come up with something new close to level of The Wall? Is it not more productive if they give a real effort for a new album instead of reissuing The Wall? Will you be giving them 5 stars for any version of The wall? Do you suggest (by giving 5 stars) that Pink floyd should continue to re- release The Wall for another 30 years? Get real, we do not need this one. Do not get me wrong.

There's not enough to cover both side rails, but he seems to only like to chew one side anyways. He hasn't chewed any more chunks of wood since putting this on and he seems content to chew on this instead. The only negative about this product is that the adhesive is not holding one of the ends down. I let it set for over 8 hours, so that's not the problem. It's only in one section, though. Fortunately, it isn't making it so my son's pulling it all the way off, so I'm overall pleased with this purchase.",,1.0

Instead of making it right and sending the bowl, they said I could send it back which of course I knew. It was a take it or leave it situation.

TONE_POLARITY,"I originally had my heart set on the BOB but couldn't justify spending the money. After reading the reviews on this stroller, I decided to go with it because all of the reviews seemed positive. The first time I tried the stroller, the left side wobbled a lot and the front tire shook. After having several people look at it, they decided it was put together correctly and it shouldn't have that problem. Long story short, I ended up returning the stroller and got the BOB. The BOB is the best stroller I have ever owned and it is definitely worth the money!",,0.0

I admit to a certain innocence regarding the brand as I thought that the bottles would be Lalique (I should have realized from the price that it would be unlikely). When they arrived, I could smell the cologne through the packaging, so I opened it up to see if a bottle broke. Indeed, one bottle had leaked. Even more disconcerting, though, were the bottles themselves. The decorative tops are a cheap, molded plastic. The leaking, cheap bottles simply could not be used as a gift.

TONE_POLARITY,"I think it unfair to Ms. Keyes that anyone would compare her to Res, who is so much more womanly and connected to her musical style than Alicia. The Res debut is more cohesive, weaving lyrics and production into a nearly seamless cloth. Even the track listing seems ordered to further your listening pleasure. Aside from the bonus track, which I have to be in the mood for, ""How I Do"" is very much a plug-and-play CD, in contrast to the highly skippable and aptly-titled ""Songs in A Minor"". With Alicia, much as with Aaliyah, there is a disjoint between her startling vocal ability and her production, in Alicia's case an underdeveloped over-synthesized jangle that does nothing to compliment her behind the piano. Alicia's debut is teeny-bop pop and does not reach me on an adult level.I recommend buying Res now and giving Alicia a little time to grow up.",,1.0
